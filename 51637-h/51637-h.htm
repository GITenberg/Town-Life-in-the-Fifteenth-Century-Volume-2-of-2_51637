<p class="pch">THE TOWN MANNERS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> controversy concerning the bounds and limits
of their freedom, which the English boroughs were
forced to maintain with powerful organizations
already settled in the land&mdash;with the monarchy, the
baronage, or the Church&mdash;represented in the history
of each municipality that which in the case of States
of greater magnitude we call the foreign policy of the
commonwealth. But whatever may be the compass
of a dominion, whether it be a borough or an empire,
no influence is more potent in shaping the character
and destiny of the community than the nature of its
external relations. It was in the single-handed
conflict with foreign powers, whether superior lord or
insidious rival, that the drapers and mercers, the
smiths and butchers and weavers of every country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
town were forced, with a patriotism quickened by
necessity, to meddle in matters of State and to
concern themselves about the public weal; their
ardours were stirred by legends of an ancient freedom,
while their political instinct was trained by
incessant discussion of legal precedent and right;
and in the strain of perpetual taxation, in heavy
burdens imposed upon a people whose prosperity was
new, uncertain, or shifting; above all in the
strengthening of certain forms of narrow municipal
despotism born of the struggle against external
danger, they paid the price of a bracing public
discipline.</p>

<p>But there is another side of the town history
which is not less important, and which is far more
complicated than the question of its foreign relations
and policy&mdash;that is, the problem of its own nature,
of the spirit by which it was animated and the
inherent resources of its corporate life. In the town
a new world had grown up with an organization and
a polity of its own wholly different from that of the
country. Members who joined its community were
compelled to renounce all other allegiance and forego
any protection from other patrons. The chief
magistrate set over its inhabitants must be one of
their own fellow-citizens&mdash;“not a far dweller” unless
in time of special need, such as war, and then only
“by the pleasure of the commonalty.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Adventurers
from the manor-houses of the neighbourhood and
strangers in search of fortune were equally shut out;
and it was only when a county squire was willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
throw in his lot with the burghers, to turn into a
good citizen and honest tradesman, and to prove his
credit and capacity by serving in a subordinate post,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
that he could hope to rise to the highest office. It
is true that country folk were welcome to pay a
double price for having a stall in the market, or a
store-room in the Common House for their wool;
while the impoverished knight might come in search
of a renewal of his wasted fortunes through the
dowry of some rich mercer’s daughter. But otherwise
the town carried on its existence apart, in a
watchful and jealous independence. Its way of life,
its code of manners, its habits, aims, and interests,
the condition of the people, the local theories of
trade by which its conduct of business was guided,
the popular views of citizenship and government
under the influence of which the burghers regulated
their civic policy&mdash;all these things must be kept in
view if we would gain a clear idea of the growth of
the borough from within.</p>

<p>The way of thinking and acting of the new world
of traders and shopkeepers and artizans lives again
for us in a wholly new literature which first sprang
up in England about the middle of the fifteenth
century&mdash;in Books of Courtesy and popular
rhymes as to the conduct of daily life. The first
English manual of etiquette appeared about 1430.
Germany had had its book of courtesy more than
two hundred years before, a set of rules composed
for a distinguished society by equally fastidious
writers, one of whom laments that his pen had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
made “common” by writing about masters and
servants, and explains that it was never happy
save in describing knights and ladies. In northern
Italy a similar book drawn up in the thirteenth
century had taken a very different character. There
the merchants and shopkeepers of the towns, impatient
of “new ceremonies” brought in from over
the mountains which they deemed contrary to all the
traditions of the traders of Lucca and Florence and
only fit for the degenerate Neapolitans, framed rules
to suit their own needs and aspirations. The French
followed rather later, at the end of the fourteenth
century; and then last of all came the English
experiment.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The very appearance of such a book at this time
is most significant. The nobles had already their
own literary traditions handed down from an older
world; and in the ideal of chivalrous conduct which
was enshrined for them in the “Morte d’Arthur,”
the Knights of the Round Table still served as a
standard of social virtue and good bearing for the
upper classes&mdash;a standard with which the burghers
had nothing whatever to do. But the new literature
was for the townsfolk themselves, and it bore on
every line the impress of its origin. A growing
sense of dignity and self-respect in the middle class
of traders and artizans wakened aspirations for
polite manners, and intercourse with strangers
abroad gave fresh stimulus to social ambition.
Englishmen who visited Flanders towards the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the century were as much impressed by the
Flemish manners as by the Flemish wealth: “they
can best behave them and most like gentlemen,”
was their comment.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In England the new society,
with no heritage of tradition and no recognized array
of models in the past, had to create its own standard
of behaviour, to shape its own social code, to realize
for itself the art of life. Compilers worked busily in
the service of the middle-class aspirants. One book
of courtesy after another was adapted for the vulgar
use. The “Rules of S. Robert,” the good Bishop of
Lincoln, whereby “whosoever will keep these rules
well will be able to live on his means and keep
himself and those belonging to him,” were put into
English in a brief form, after wearing a more
courtly garb of French or Latin for three centuries.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
A Latin treatise on manners was translated
for the unlearned by a writer who prayed for help
in his work from Him who formed man after
His own image, from Mary the gracious Mother,
and from Lady Facetia the Mother of all virtue.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Sound codes of morals were put in the form of
an A B C.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The right conduct of life, especially as it
concerned polite behaviour, was set out in little
songs “made for children young, at the school that
bide not long.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Plain directions in verse pointed
out the duties of girls, of young men, of housewives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of wandering youths looking for service. The rhymes
are of the homeliest kind, with trite and prosaic
illustrations taken from the common sights of the
market-place, the tavern, the workshop, or the
street with its wandering pigs and its swinging
signs; it is in their very rudeness and simpleness
that their interest lies. Meanwhile political and
satirical songs which had been so common in the
foregoing centuries mostly died out of fashion and
were heard no more, as the burghers, quickened into a
new self-consciousness, began to be concerned for a
time with matters nearer home.</p>

<p>These fragments of old speech and song lead us into
the very midst of the lanes and workshops of a
mediæval town. They recall for us the countless
political and social troubles amid which the trader
was slowly fighting his way upward, and which left
their deep impress on his character and view of life.
A pervading suspicion, a distrustful caution, are the
ground-note of many a song. Rude proverbs of daily
speech, jingling rhymes of wise counsel, all are profoundly
marked by the narrow prudence of people
set in the midst of pit-falls, to whom danger was ever
present, whether at the council chamber or at the
tavern or at a friend’s dinner table, and among whom
talk and clatter with the tongue were looked on as
an unspeakable indiscretion.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They picture a life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
anxious and difficult, whose recognized condition is
one of toil that knows no relaxation and no end, of
hardship borne with unquestioning endurance&mdash;a life
amid whose humble prosperity family affection and the
family welfare are best assured by having one roof,
one entrance door, one fire, and one dining table, and
a “back door” is looked on as an extravagance which
would bring any household to ruin. After a man
had lived hard and worked strenuously he still stood in
need of the constantly recurring warning against any
bitterness of envy at the prosperity of a lucky dealer
next door. The limits of his ambition and his duty
are bounded by rigid lines; and the standard of
conduct is one framed for a laborious middle
class, with its plain-spoken seriousness, its sturdy
morality, its activity and rectitude and independence,
its dulness and vigilance and thrift. It is the duty of
good men to set their people well to work, to keep house
carefully, to get through any heavy job steadily and

<p class="pp8q p1">“Be as pure as flour taken from the bran<br />

<p class="pn1">With one whom “thou knowest of greater state”
there should be no easy fellowship, no dining or

be no show of overmuch “meekness” or servility,

to pay their tithes, to give to the poor, to be
strong and stiff against the devil. The prayer on
awaking, the daily mass before working hours, the
duties of self-control and submission, must ever be
kept in mind. For the trader indeed the way of
virtue was a narrow one and straight. Three deaths
ever stand menacingly before him. First comes the
common lot, the mere severing of soul and body.</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“The tother death is death of Shame,<br />
If he die in debt or wicked fame;<br />
The third death, so saith the clerks,<br />

<p class="p1">But side by side with directions about mercy, truth,
and fulfilling the law, come other warnings&mdash;warnings
about carving meat and cutting bread and dividing
cheese, about a formal and dignified bearing, how to
walk and stand and kneel, how to enter a house or greet
a friend in the street&mdash;all carefully and laboriously
shaped into rhyme. In the new sense of changing
customs, of fashions that came and went with the
revolutions of society,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> training and thought and conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
endeavour were called in to replace the simplicity
of the old unvarying forms. Manners became a subject
of serious anxiety. Throwing aside the mass of tradition
handed down from century to century, when every
usage was consecrated by custom, and determined
by immemorial laws as to the relations of class to
class, the burghers, side by side with the professional
and middle classes all over the kingdom, were
tending towards the realization of a new social order,
in which men were no longer obliged as formerly to
pass through the door of the Church to find the way
of social advancement, but might attain to it along
the common high road of secular enterprise. The
notion of the worth of the individual man was none
the less important for the homely and practical form
given to it in their rude and untrained expression.
No one, they declared simply, need be shamefaced,
of whatever lowly position he might come, for</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“In hall or chamber, or where thou gon,<br />
Nurture and good manners maketh man.”</p>

<p class="pn1">In whatever society he might find himself, the
humblest citizen should therefore so order his behaviour
that when he left the table men would say
“A gentleman was here.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The practical divinity of
plain people easily drew the graciousness of outward
demeanour within the sphere of religion, and “clerks
that knew the seven arts” explained</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“That courtesy from heaven came<br />
When Gabriel our Lady grette<br />
And Elizabeth with Mary mette.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">Since “all virtues are closed in courtesy and all
vices in villany” or rudeness, the best prayer one
could make was to be well-mannered, for the virtues
of a fine behaviour reached as far as thought could go.</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“In courtesy He make you so expert,<br />
That through your nurture and your governance,<br />
In lasting bliss He may yourself advance.”</p>

<p class="p1">These books of courtesy show us one side of
the great change that passed over society<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> when
the mediæval theory of <i>status</i> was broken down
by the increase of riches which trade brought with
it, and the new chances of rising in the world
through wealth. The yeoman might become a gentleman
by getting into a lord’s household, and “spending
large and plenty.” The squire who would be a knight
without the danger of bearing arms need only go to the
king’s court with his purse full of money. The man
of letters, the merchant, the seeker after pleasure,
whoever and whatever a man might be, he could win
neither degree nor worship “but he have the penny
ready to take to.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> When the acquisition of wealth
or the passage from one class to another was practically
impossible, poverty and a low estate might still
be dignified. But as soon as fortune and position had
been brought within the reach of all, the man who
remained poor might be looked on as idle or incapable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
A new test of superiority was applied, a test of
material prosperity, and by this measure the townsman
was judged by his neighbours and naturally
judged himself. On all sides we find indications
of the excited ambition which had begun to stir in
every class,</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Now every boy will counterfeit a knight,<br />
Report himself as good as he.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">New distinctions of rank and caste began to appear,
and an aristocracy of energy and skill constantly
recruited and invigorated made its influence felt in
every borough, as public honour was attached to trade
in proportion to the wealth which its followers could
win. The wool trade especially held a place of distinction
in common esteem; and people who took to
the selling of cloth were supposed to “live like
gentlemen” and rejoice in a really superior station.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
More and more the enriched burgher hastened to
give proof that he had risen into the leisured class by
donning the fine dress whose cumbrous folds bespoke
a sedate idleness and luxury, so that whereas “sometime
afar men might lords know by their array from
other folk, now a man shall stand or muse a long
throw which is which.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>As the chance of rising in the world stirred in the
trader a new ambition, so it stirred too the sense of
the power of knowledge. When the writer of Piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Ploughman counts up the gifts of the Spirit that were
distributed among the commons at the descent of the
Holy Ghost as “treasure to live by to their lives’ end,”
and “weapon to fight with when Anti-Christ assaileth,”
he carefully reckons in with the rest the wit to use
words skilfully as preachers and prentices of law who
live leally by labour of tongue, the crafts and “connynge”
of sight by which men win their livelihood
with selling and buying, the wisdom to till and thatch
and cook as their wit would when the time came;
the art of divining and dividing numbers, and all such
learning of the schools.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Already the workers of the
town were reaching forward, as some of their rough
rhymes show, to a true love of learning.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Their zeal
took very practical form. Side by side with the great
movement for education which was going on under
the patronage of kings and queens, of archbishops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bishops, and great lords and ladies, humbler work was
taken in hand by burghers and tradesmen for the
teaching of their own people.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The founding of free
grammar schools all over England was the work of
the trading classes themselves. Sometimes the schools
were founded by Guilds.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Sometimes townsmen who
had thriven in the world remembered gratefully the
place of their birth or their education. “By some
divine chance” a “teacher of grammar learning”
came to live in Rotherham about the beginning of
the fifteenth century, and one of the town boys,
Thomas Scott, who had been taught by him about
1430, became in 1474 Lord Chancellor, and in
1480 Archbishop of York. In 1483 he founded a
college in his old home with a Provost and three
Fellows who were to teach freely any one who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to them. One was to give lessons in grammar,
poetry, and rhetoric; the second in music, especially
singing, playing, and broken song; and if possible
these two were to be priests, or at least one of
them. The third Fellow was to teach writing and
arithmetic to youths who were not intended for the
priesthood, but for trades and other employments;
for among the children of Rotherham, said the archbishop,
there were many who were “valde acuti in
ingenio.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In the same way bishop Alcock of
Rochester, the son of a Hull merchant, established a
free grammar school at Hull, where the master was
to “teach all scholars thither resorting without
taking any stipend or wages for the same, and should
have for his own wages £10.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>So in one way or another the work of education
went on throughout the fifteenth century&mdash;a work
whose magnitude and importance have been too long
obscured by the busy organizers of the Reformation
days, who, for the giving of a new charter or adapting
the school to the new system established by law,
clothed themselves with the glory of founders and
bore away from their silent predecessors the honour
of inaugurating a new world. Not only in the busy
centres of commerce, but in the obscure villages
that lay hidden in forest or waste or clung to the
slopes of the northern moors, the children of the later
middle ages were gathered into schools. Apparently,
reading and writing were everywhere common among
the people,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and as early as the reign of Richard the
Second the word “townsmen” had come to mean
people instructed and trained, and no longer ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rustics.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But the most remarkable thing about the
growth of the new grammar schools was the part
taken in their foundation by laymen&mdash;by the traders
and merchants of the towns. The great benefactor of
Sandwich, Thomas Elys, left provision in 1392 for
one of the chaplains of his chantry to serve as schoolmaster
for the town boys; and the son of a draper
who had had his education in this school afterwards
founded a grammar school. Sir Edmund Shaa,
goldsmith and once Lord Mayor of London,
established a school at Stockport by will in 1457,
and appointed a chantry priest of the parish church,
who, being “cunning in grammar,” should “freely
without any wages or salary asking or taking of any
person, except only any salary hereunder specified,
shall teach all manner persons, children and other,
that will come to him to learn as well of the said
town of Stopford as of other towns thereabouts, the
science of grammar as far as lieth in him for to do.”
And another London mayor, Sir John Percyvale, who
had been born close to Macclesfield, left money in
1502 to endow a free grammar school there, because
there were few schoolmasters in that country and the
children for lack of teaching “fall to idleness and so
consequently live dissolutely all their days.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
seems also that the Manchester Grammar School was
first planned by a Manchester clothier, who at his
death left money for its foundation; and was
completed in 1524 by Hugh Oldham, Bishop of
Exeter, a native of Oldham;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the children were to
be taught “after the manner of the school of
Banbury,” and inhabitants of the town were compelled
to contribute to its support by being forced
to grind their corn at the school mills&mdash;a custom
which was kept up till 1759.</p>

<p>The new movement marked the beginning of that
revolution which was ultimately to take education
out of the exclusive control of the Church and hand
it over to the people themselves. Up to this time
the privileges and profits of teaching had been practically
a monopoly of the clergy, and there was no
possible competition save that which might spring up
between licensed and unlicensed teachers within the
ecclesiastical order.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> A document drawn up by order
of the abbot of Walden tells how the clergy of
the parish church there had taught some children
of the village the alphabet, and even more advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
lessons, without leave from the abbot, who claimed
by the statutes and customs of the monastery a
perpetual monopoly of teaching or licensing schoolmasters.
A petition was made by the inhabitants
in favour of the priests, and in consequence of this
petition the abbot, to the great satisfaction of the
townsfolk, graciously allowed that every priest of
the Church might (during the goodwill of the abbot
and convent) receive one “very little child” of each
inhabitant, and might teach the child in “alphabete
et graciis”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but not in any higher learning; a legal
instrument embodying this concession was drawn up
by a clerk of the York diocese, and signed with a
beautiful notarial monogram which must have cost
him the greater part of a day to draw.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But under the new state of things another element
was brought into the controversy. The town itself
occasionally became the aggressive party, and took
the teaching straight out of the hands of the priest.
An order was made at Bridgenorth in 1503 “that
there shall no priest keep no school, save only one
child to help him to say mass, after that a schoolmaster
cometh to town, but that every child to resort
to the common school in pain of forfeiting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
chamber of the town twenty shillings of every priest
that doeth the contrary.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Burghers accustomed to
manage their own affairs easily assumed the direction
of education, and the control of schools gradually
passed from clerical to lay hands and became the
charge of the whole community. In Nottingham,
where there had been a grammar school before 1382
at which it would seem that a boy’s education cost
eightpence a term,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> a new free school was founded in
1512, probably by the widow of a former mayor, and
was put directly under the management of the mayor
and town council,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and as these apparently proved
somewhat negligent in the business the Leet jury
constantly interfered in the most officious way in the
government of the school and the choice and supervision
of its teachers. “It will be a credit,” they
said, “to have a good master and a good ussher in
one school.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Of the intellectual life of the towns we know
scarcely anything, and there is perhaps not much to
be known. Scholars naturally drifted away to the
Universities or London, and the society of the
borough was occupied with other matters than
learning. In Nottingham, in spite of the educational
zeal of the jury, the first evidence we have of a town
clerk who knew enough of the classics to quote a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of Vergil and a line of Horace is in 1534-1545;
while it is not till 1587 that we find a clerk who had
learned Greek.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> On the other hand Bristol was
evidently a centre of radiant light. An excellent
education was given in its school, if we judge from
the famous Grocyn, who was brought up there and
left the school in 1463;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and its society was adorned
by men of culture and wide intellectual curiosity.
William of Worcester, the enquirer after universal
knowledge, a man of science who practised medicine
and cultivated his garden of herbs, as well as a man
of letters, who at forty-three “hath gone to school to
a Lombard called Karoll Giles to learn and to be read
in poetry or else in French,” and to whom “a good
book of French or of poetry” seemed as fine a purchase
as “a fair manor,” might be seen in his later
days at Bristol, practising the art of annalist, in
which character he surveyed the whole town and
carefully measured it by paces from end to end.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
His friend Ricart, town clerk and historian, spent
the twenty-seven years of his clerkship in writing
his Calendar or Chronicle of 332 leaves in six carefully
arranged parts, the first three being devoted
to history and the last three to local customs and
laws, in which he carried the story of Bristol through
3,000 years from the days of Brut to the reign of
Edward the Fourth.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>It was inevitable that the purpose and theory of
education should ultimately be modified by the
change of masters, as well as by the change of
manners, and already fervent reformers like Caxton
began to look beyond “the alphabet and humanities”
and discuss training in the mysteries of the English
tongue itself. Among the “fathers ancient” who
should command the reverence of scholars they
counted the famous men of their own race and speech&mdash;men
removed from them by but a generation or
two&mdash;Chaucer “the father and founder of ornate
eloquence,” Lydgate, the maker of “volumes that be
large and wide,” and Occleve; and it is touching to
see men, on the very eve of the heroic age of English
literature, wistfully looking back to the vanished
glories of their grandfather days, when, as it
seemed to them, all the “fresh flowers” of style had
been reaped by this handful of ancient worthies, and
“of silver language the great riches” stored away in
their treasury, so that the painful toiler who came
after in search of “the embalmed tongue and aureate
sentence,” could now get it only by piece-meal, or at
the most might glean here and there by busy diligence
something to show that he had reverently visited
the fields of the blest.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The enlightened zeal of the
learned indeed had still to wage a long warfare
with the pedants of the schools and the barbaric
notions of education that governed men’s minds;
and the training vouchsafed to the poor boys of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
fifteenth century was then and for many a century
afterwards a rude and brutal one.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> No doubt, too,
the trader’s view of education, practical as it was,
had a touch of unashamed vulgarity. “To my
mind,” says the Capper in the Commonweal, “it
made no matter if there were no learned men at all,”
for “the devil a whit good do ye with your studies
but set men together by the ears;” what men
wanted was “to write and read, and learn the
languages used in countries about us, that we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
write our minds to them and they to us.” Scholars,
on the other hand, trembled at the results to civilization
and knowledge of the crude ideals of the mere
man of business, who if he had his way would “in a
short space make this realm empty of wise and
politic men, and consequently barbarous, and at the
last thrall and subject to other nations; for empire is
not so much won and kept by the manhood or force
of men as by wisdom and policy,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which is gotten
chiefly by learning.” But whatever were their
faults it was in the schools as much as in the
council-chamber or shop that the revolution of the
next century was being prepared; and the wide-reaching
results of the spread of education in town
and village were potent factors in the developement
of a later England. “The fault is in yourselves,
ye noblemen’s sons,” wrote Ascham, “and therefore
ye deserve the greater blame, that commonly the
meaner men’s children come to be the wisest counsellors
and greatest doers in the weighty affairs of
this realm.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWN MARKET</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Close</span> under the sheltering walls of the parish
church we may look for the market of a mediæval
town, with stalls leaning against the building where
possibly the first beginnings of trade had found shelter,
where before any market was held the people of the
neighbourhood assembled on feast days and sold meat
and bread at the church without fear of being called
on for any payment for toll and stallage;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and in
which, after the community had been endowed with
market rights, the rulers and governors of the market
met, the guardians of its weights and measures, the
makers of its laws, the assessors of its tolls, the supervisors
of its wares. There, while the national government
was drifting in perplexity at the mercy of court
factions, agitated by problems of the King’s civil list,
pensions to nobles, and the conquest of France, the
towns were rapidly sketching out their commercial
system and tentatively laying down the main lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
into which the national policy was ultimately to be
driven.</p>

<p>The market had long been kept out of view by its
more showy predecessor the fair&mdash;the offspring of an
immemorial antiquity, whose very name<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> betrays its
origin in the ancient gatherings at feasts heathen
or Christian, and reveals it as an institution derived
from old tribal and national usages. Gradually
expanding in later times with the growth of the royal
prerogative and necessities of commerce, and drawing
to its miscellaneous gatherings strange merchants
fetched from far and near, the fair had a brilliant
history of its own; it had given birth to universal
commerce and watched over its growth; it became
the foster-mother of the Merchant Law; even now
it still appears with the lavish airs of an antique
benefactor casting on the green its faded gifts of holyday
and merry-go-round and quack delights. But as
long ago as the fifteenth century the superannuated
fair was already falling into a slow decrepitude, and
giving place to its successor, the product of a later
order of things.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> For the market had another origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and might trace back its descent to the traditions
of the Roman <i>municipia</i>, and claim the Roman
Pandects for its sponsors, and show itself fortified
by customs and modes of administration handed
down to England with many another legacy from
the laws of the Frankish kings.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> With all its air
of being the very work and possession of the people,
the market was by descent no popular or tribal
right; it was the king’s prerogative; its tolls and
customs were regulated by the authority of the
Justices of the King’s Bench, and its prices were
proclaimed by the king’s Clerk of the Market.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>What kings could not themselves profitably enjoy,
however, was generally to be bought at some reasonable
price. The privilege of holding a market could
be transferred as a franchise to a subject, and the
whole market system in England grew up by means
of royal grants of monopolies to individuals or to
corporations. Between the years 1200 and 1482,
almost 5000 local centres of organized trade were
established by grants of markets and fairs,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
towns were naturally well to the fore in securing
whatever bargains were being distributed. But the
origin of the privilege was always independent in
theory of the ordinary municipal franchises;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and in
many important boroughs freedom from the Steward
and Marshal of the Household and the royal Clerk
of the Market was one of the last rights given to
the people.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Closely connected with the right to hold a market
was the right to keep a Beam or Steelyard with its
weights, a yard measure, and a bushel.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> On the
day that each new mayor entered on his office,
he received from his predecessor the common chest,
the town treasure, and the standard measures;
and was required forthwith to send out his councillors
to the house of every shopkeeper, baker,
brewer, or innkeeper, that they might carry all
bushels, gallons, quarts, yards, or weights back to the
Mayor’s house to be compared with the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
models and duly sealed.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Thenceforth it was his
business to make war on spicers and grocers who
sold by horn or aim of hand or by subtlety deceived
the poor commons, on brewers who used cups and
dishes instead of lawful measures,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> on drapers who
measured after their own devices, on weavers who
used stones and not sealed weights to buy their wool;
even merchants of the Staple and country squires and
foreign dealers brought their wool to the “Trove” or
Balance, with a fee for the “Fermour of the Beme,”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> as
soon as general trade proved the inconvenience of
a variety of local weights, or of the primitive method
of using stones which still survived in the fifteenth
century, when a Yorkshire steward writes to his
master, “I have a counterpoise weight of the weight
stone that the wool was weighed with, and that ye
see that the stone be kept that the shipman brings.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Thus the market with its Beam and measures
became the source and centre of an activity absolutely
new&mdash;an activity which crowded the roads not only
with merchants and chapmen, but with the new race
of carriers that was created at the end of the fourteenth
century to transport the dealer’s wares
throughout the length and breadth of the country.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Dealers and manufacturers gathered in groups round
the central Cheap and its Balance with authentic
sealed weights, and gave the names of their several
trades to the alleys in which butchers or milksellers
clustered together, or where spurriers and goldsmiths
had their shops, and grocers, mercers, wool-dealers,
and cloth merchants were ranged in ordered ranks
round the Guildhall for the greater convenience of
the municipal officers. What the new movement
meant we can see in the change that passed over the
face of English boroughs. The first sight of a
mediæval town must have carried little promise to
the visitor. We have a lively picture of the state of
Hythe given by the presentments of its reforming
jury in the beginning of the fifteenth century, from
which it is not easy to understand how the inhabitants
ever made their way about the town at all. Streets
were choked with the refuse of the stable, made
impassable by the “skaldynge de hogges,” flooded by
the overflow of a house, drowned by the turning of
a watercourse out of its way or the putting up of
a dam by some private citizen heedless of all consequences
to the public road. Timber dealers cast
trunks of trees right across the street, dyers poured
their waste waters over it till it became a mere
swamp, builders blocked it up utterly with the framework
of their new houses, and traders made their
wharves upon it. Not only the most thriving and
respectable merchants, such as the Honywodes, but
the butcher and swine-keeper as well, threw the waste
of house and shambles and swine-cote into the open
street till there was scarcely any passage left for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
wayfarer; or established a “hoggestok,” “which
smells very badly and is abominable to all men
coming to market, as well as to all dwelling in the
town,” say the jury. There was hardly a street or
lane which was not described as “almost stinking and
a nuisance.” The “Cherche Weye” was occupied by
the pits of a skinner. “There was no carrying
through Brokhellislane.” The street by which the
procession went on Holy Thursday, the day of perambulation
of the town, could scarcely be traversed.
Everywhere gates and bridges were falling to decay,
ditches unrepaired, and hedges overgrown; and one
offender who had obstructed a road by neglecting to
repair the ditches found an easy way of escape from
his obligations by a courtesy to the Bailiff&mdash;“the
dyeing of two cloths that the said ditches may not
have to be repaired.” Worse still the Holy Well was
choked with refuse, and so was the well in West
Hythe, and “the water in the cart of Geoffrey
Waterleader by which the whole community is
refreshed” was equally obstructed and spoiled by the
refuse of the butchers’ shambles. It is no wonder
that pestilence devastated Hythe in 1412, as
throughout the century it swept over one town after
another. But it has been calculated that even
without the aid of pestilence the ordinary mortality
of a borough in the Middle Ages was almost equal to
that of a town during a visitation of cholera to-day.
Even the first well-meant efforts of Corporations to
shut pigs out of their streets and banish wandering
dogs, by levying fines from any inhabitant who had
an “irrational animal going about” in the churchyard<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
or the market, doubtless added to the dangers
of pestilence by removing the only scavengers known
to the early borough.</p>

<p>Nor was this the condition of the smaller towns
only. In Nottingham, a thriving and prosperous
borough, we read in the same way of streets blocked
with piles of cinders cast out smoking hot from the
bell-foundry or the iron workshops, or with heaps
of corn which the householders winnowed, or as
they said “windowed,” by the simple method of
throwing it from an upper window or door into the
street that the wind might carry away the chaff.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In
the yet wealthier manufacturing city of Norwich the
market place was not yet paved in 1507, but a judicious
order was issued that no one should dig holes in it to
get sand without the mayor’s licence.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The very
attempt to get access to a town was often not
wholly free from peril. In 1499 a glover from
Leighton Buzzard travelled with his wares to Aylesbury
for the market before Christmas Day. It
happened that an Aylesbury miller, Richard Boose,
finding that his mill needed repairs, sent a couple of
servants to dig clay “called Ramming clay” for him on
the highway, and was in no way dismayed because the
digging of this clay made a great pit in the middle of
the road ten feet wide, eight feet broad, and eight
feet deep, which was quickly filled with water by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
winter rains. But the unhappy glover, making his
way from the town in the dusk, with his horse laden
with paniers full of gloves, straightway fell into the
pit, and man and horse were drowned. The miller
was charged with his death, but was acquitted by the
court on the ground that he had had no malicious
intent, and had only dug the pit to repair his mill,
and because he really did not know of any other
place to get the kind of clay he wanted save the
highroad.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>All this heritage of squalor and rough disorder
however was no longer accepted without protest.
Old abuses were brought to light and denounced.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Towns were swept and garnished, stately market
crosses set up, and new Guild-halls everywhere built
with shops and stalls and storage rooms for the
traders. A new interest was awakened in the state of
streets<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and lanes and central squares when waggons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and pack horses began to struggle through the mire
with their loads on market day. And as travellers
multiplied&mdash;busy men intent on bargains, traders
flocking to buy and sell, mayors and clerks of distant
boroughs come to negociate a commercial treaty, men
of law having the conduct of a new charter, common
earners&mdash;all travellers who no longer cared (and some
of them for very obvious reasons) to depend on the
hospitality of monasteries, the towns with one accord
began to provide inns where, to the greater profit of
the community, such men might turn for shelter;
and the more luxurious among them might discover
good cheer which demanded a grateful entry&mdash;“paid
for our bed there, and it was well worth it, witness, a
feather bed 1<i>d.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Everywhere a new order reigned
under the busy rule of the municipal officers, as they
leased out the market stalls and sheds,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> appointed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
corresponding pews in the church, allotted storage
rooms in the Guildhall, issued licenses to alien traders,
and controlled the wayward will of the sellers by
regulating their prices and their profits. Goods
landed at the wharves of a seaport were delivered up
to the public porters and measurers of the Strand<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
employed by the town to unload vessels with pulleys
and ropes supplied at the common expense, and to
carry them to the appointed place for toll or for
inspection; and the town brokers&mdash;public officers
sworn to make no private profit while they held their
posts&mdash;conducted bargains in the name of the whole
community,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> freighted vessels, and measured cargoes
of corn or canvas or cloth. Before the mayor the
endless officials of the market were sworn&mdash;the clerk
of the market who had to search and survey all
victuals, the sergeant who carried the toll-box on
market days after the bailiffs,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> the “leave-lookers,”
the “decennaries,” the “prud’hommes,”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the butchers
chosen to oversee the meat market, the men appointed
to control the sale of fish and poultry, the common
weigher, and so on through the long and various
list of officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>A vast system of ingenious and elaborate regulations<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
marked the long effort of the townspeople
to carry out in their new markets the apparently
simple end which lay at the heart of the democracy,
that food and necessaries of life both good
and cheap should be within the reach of every
man. According to the theory which still held its
ground in the sixteenth century that “victual being
a necessary sustenance for the body should not be
esteemed at the seller’s liberty,”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> a fixed price was
set on all provisions. Hence the Assize of Bread<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
(apparently quite neglected by the feudal lords<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>) and
the Assizes of Beer and of Wine were secured by the
towns, whether as a part of their market rights or as
an independent privilege.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Victuallers were closely
watched lest in selling meat, eggs, butter, or oatmeal
they should take “excess lucre upon them, selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that is to say more than 1<i>d.</i> in the shilling;”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> innholders
were allowed a penny of gain on every bushel
of corn and a half-penny on every seven pounds of
hay, so that if a man could buy a bushel of corn<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> for
2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> he was not allowed to sell it for 3<i>s.</i>; tavern-keepers
might have twopence profit on a gallon of
white or red wine, and on sweet wines brought by
Italian merchants, fourpence;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> cooks must make
their meat “well seasoned and wholesome, and sell it
for reasonable winning, and that they reboil nor
rebake no meat in hurt of the King’s people;” while
fishmongers&mdash;a class most important in the mediæval
world, and among whom it was impossible to prevent
the growth of the middleman, were subjected to endless
regulations.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In the unceasing effort to save
themselves from dearth or from fraud the poor
commons had their authorized protector in the
Mayor&mdash;a protector who on entering office took
oath before the community not only to obey the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
King but also to serve the people, and to “keep
truly correction on all bakers and brewers and
taverners and cooks and such like people.” No
sooner was the Mayor of Bristol installed than he
was bound to call all the bakers of the town to the
Guild Hall, to understand from them what stuff they
had of wheat, to counsel them in their buying and
bargaining with the “Bagers” who brought corn to
the town, and to decide on the size of the loaves.
Then all the Bristol brewers were summoned before
him, that he might commune with them about the
cost of malt, and decree a fixed price which no
brewer might evade or alter. In like manner he
proceeded to set a price on wood “by his wise
discretion,” and to order the hours of its sale; and
he had to examine the colliers’ sacks, and to assure
himself that standard measures for coal were set in
the proper places of the town. Further, throughout
the year it was his duty constantly to watch that
his ordinances were duly observed. Occasionally
his walk was extended along the river side, that he
might keep an eye on the timber trade and observe
whether the great wood called Berkeley wood was
discharged at one quay, and the smaller faggots at
another landing-place; and that he might from spring
to spring watch prices, and see that there was small
wood enough to supply the poor people with bundles
at 1/2<i>d.</i> or 1<i>d.</i> kept at the “Back,” a waterside street
where the merchants’ stores were piled. At divers
times he went to oversee the quality of the bread
and try its weight (for which perhaps, as at Sandwich,
he engaged a goldsmith who was liberally paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for his experience at the scales); while at Christmas,
or whenever there was holiday or a pilgrimage in the
town, it was his business to make sure that there
was bread enough in the shops to supply all needs.
And in order to know certainly that the brewers not
only made good ale for the rich but also a cheap
small drink for the poor, on Wednesdays and Saturdays
he was “used to walk in the mornings to the
brewers’ houses, to oversee them in serving of their
ale to the poor commons of the town, and that they
have their true measures; and his ale-konner with
him to taste and understand that the ale be good”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>&mdash;a
very necessary task if we accept the picture
given us in Piers Ploughman of the typical beer-seller
of his day&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">
“Yea, bawe,” quoth a brewer, “I will not be ruled,<br />
By Jesus, for all your jangling after <i>spiritus justicie</i>;<br />
Nor after conscience, by Christ, for I could sell<br />
Both dregs and draff, and draw at one hole<br />
Thick ale and thin ale, and that is my kind,<br />
And not to hack after holiness; hold thy tongue, Conscience!<br />
Of <i>spiritus justicie</i> thou speakest much and idle.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">The Nottingham jury a century or two later would
have drawn the same picture. “Master Mayor,” they
cry, “we beseech you to be good master to us, and
see a remedy for our brewers, for we find us grieved
with them all.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Nor did legislation stop here. The moment a
trader came within reach of a town he became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
object of universal suspicion lest he should be a
dealer travelling with an alert intention to outwit
the public and force an artificial value in the
market by some contrivance of forestalling or regrating
or engrossing&mdash;that is of intercepting goods
on the way to market in order to buy them more
cheaply; of thus buying at advantage to sell at
increased prices; or of keeping back goods bought
at wholesale prices in order to sell them later at a
better value. A jealous watch was kept on him.
He was not allowed to do any business secretly or
outside the proper limits, but “openly in the market
thereto assigned,” and even there he was ordered to
stand aside till the townsmen had come back from
early mass and had first been served with such stores
of corn and malt, of butter and poultry and meat as
their households needed, and the bell struck the hour
when he might take his turn for what was left.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> And
as he bought so must he sell only in the established
and customary place; and food once displayed on his
shelf or stall could not be taken out of the town unsold
without leave of the bailiffs.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Any citizen who
helped a “foreign” merchant by buying or selling
goods for him under his own name lost his freedom.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Men who lived “upland”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> were rejected from the
society of privileged traders of the towns, and sharp
distinctions such as we find at Worcester between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“citizens denizen” and the “citizens foreign”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> separated
the folk within and without the walls.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In one
borough strangers’ stalls in the market were separated
from those of the burghers<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> so that they might not
hinder the townsfolk in their business; in another
they were forbidden to carry their wares from house
to house;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> here they might not sell their goods with
their own hands, there they must dispose of them
wholesale, or forfeit their entire stock to the town
if they attempted to sell by retail; elsewhere they
had to wait for a given number of weeks after their
arrival before they could offer their merchandise to
the buyer; if for public convenience aliens were
allowed to bring into the market victuals<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and a few
other articles, the monopoly of all valuable trade was
kept in the hands of the burgesses or of their Merchant
Guild.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>It is however needless to multiply instances of
monopoly. The system was universal, and a curious
attempt which was once made to establish free trade
at Liverpool died almost as soon as it was born. The
charter of Henry the Third contained the usual provision
that members of the Guild alone might trade
in the borough, unless by consent of the burgesses, but
in a new charter of Richard the Second for which he
was paid £5 this clause was left out and free trade
practically established. No sooner however did Henry
the Fourth appear in 1399 than the burgesses bought
from him for £4 a fresh grant of privileges with the
former clause restored, and the old monopoly was
consequently reasserted, till oddly enough an outburst
of religious bigotry abolished trade restrictions; for
seeing that the Liverpool Protestants were shutting
out Roman Catholics from their market, Queen Mary
in 1555 proclaimed anew the charter of Richard the
Second and the right of free commerce.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a lively smuggling trade betrays the weak side of the
monopolists’ position; as when Bristol claimed entire
control of all ports and creeks as high as Worcester,
and the only lawful trade left to Gloucester was the
shipping of supplies, mostly of corn, to Bristol.
The shippers of Gloucester saw their chance of a
rich lawless traffic; small boats quickly and easily
laden and drawing little water, shot out of the
channel by shallow passages where the bigger Bristol
ships could not follow them, and Irish vessels made
their way direct to Gloucester and escaped the heavy
dues at the Bristol port; and while Gloucester traders
grew rich fast, the Bristol folk made complaint that
they were threatened with ruin.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>This elaborate system of trade regulation was
no doubt mainly due to the effort which men were
forced to make, as centres of thicker population grew
up in a country where the carriage of goods<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
slow and difficult matter, to protect themselves from
violent changes in the price of food;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> while it is also
possible that a society which dictated wages and profits
was naturally drawn on to undertake the corresponding
duty of fixing the value in food and clothing
of these wages and profits. It would seem that for
some centuries the cost of mere subsistence remained
almost stationary; and even in exceptional cases,
like the Jubilee of 1420 which brought a hundred
thousand pilgrims to Canterbury, the corporation
which had charge of the preparations was able to
ensure that there should be no increase in the
ordinary price of provisions.</p>

<p>It has been commonly held, however, that the old
trade laws were not only invented to protect the
people’s food, but to protect wages and profits as
well; and they have been denounced as the outcome
of an ignorant selfishness; and as proving the
belief of the mediæval burghers that the industrial
prosperity of the whole community could only be
assured by their securing so complete a monopoly of
the entire trade of the borough that they might
themselves reap all the fruit of their enterprise and
gather wealth undisturbed&mdash;a belief to which modern
democracies (with one great exception) still cling,
though they throw a grander air over their creed
now-a-days by discussing protection in continents
instead of protection in a little market town. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it seems likely that protection in the modern sense
had scarcely anything to say to the great mass of
mediæval legislation about trade. No doubt it was
the natural ideal of every craft to have the State for
its nursing-mother; but the voice of the crafts was
lost in the monotonous reiteration by the general
public of their dominant principle, that manufactures
and commerce only existed for the benefit of the
whole community&mdash;the “poor commons of the
realm,” to use the phrase of that day. It was for
<i>their</i> protection that no unlicensed or unregulated
trade should be allowed to exist, that there should
be no fraudulent manufactures, no secret breaking
down of barriers set up by Parliament for the
orderly division and control of crafts, no buying
and selling by forestallers, public enemies to the
community and to the country, hastening by land
and by water to oppress the poor;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and rules devised
to check a public mischief or secure a public good
are no more to be classed as protective than regulations
for the sale of drugs or the licensing of public
houses in our own day. Such rules indeed were
often as unsolicited by the trader as they were
agreeable to the public, and all his cunning was
exerted to elude them. Some little margin of profit
was to be won beyond the city boundaries where
there was freedom from the city law and from
the city tolls. Therefore the London corporation
complained that the butchers of London “who
have bought their freedom and are sworn of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
franchise, do rent their houses at Stratford and round
Stratford, and never come at any summons nor bear
their part in the franchise of the city; but shut out
the citizens (resident butchers) in divers markets
where they ought to buy their wares, so that through
them no wares they can get to the great undoing of
the citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Bakers withdrew themselves “into
the foreign” to avoid punishment for frauds.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Candlemakers established themselves in the suburbs,
and butchers were presented “for selling of his tallow
into the country and will not sell it to a man within
the town,”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> or for carrying tallow in sacks at night
out of the city for the making up of candles; and
being punished were ordered to leave candle-making
to the chandlers, who on their part were commanded
to keep within the boundaries. In Canterbury,
where owing to the great number of ecclesiastical
tenants the main burden of taxation was thrown on
a part only of the population, and where doubtless
taxes were correspondingly high, there came a time
at last when traders of every kind, cloth-makers and
brewers and bakers, carried their business outside the
“liberties,” so that according to the story of the
mayor and council “formerly there were divers and
many habitations in which of time past were kept
good and notable households, by the which many
men and women were relieved and had their living
and increase, being now uninhabited and greatly decayed,
and some of them fall to ruin and utter destitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
... and it is well understood and known that
the principal cause thereof” was this wicked device
of the independent dealers, by which the tradesmen
in the city who had to pay “tax, tallage, and other
impositions,” could not compete with those outside
and “have not the sale and utterance of their
bread and ale, as they in times past have had, to their
great impoverishing, and manifold hurt and prejudice
to the commonweal of the said city.” The
suburban bakers sold their goods to “divers and
many simple and evil disposed persons of the city as
well to Scots, Irish, and other, which in no wise
will apply themselves to any labour or other lawful
occupations, but only they live upon sale and huckstry
of the said bread, beer, and ale, and for that they
have resorting unto them many vagabonds ...
whereby many well disposed persons be greatly
annoyed and grieved.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> To restore trade to its primitive
simplicity a law was passed with clauses against
the mercenary Scotch and Irish, the troublers of the
city’s peace, and dealers were forbidden to sell their
provisions “to no inhabitant within the said city, but
only to such persons as shall be thought by the
mayor and aldermen of good disposition and conversation.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The prejudice against unregulated trade was no
doubt reinforced by the hostility of the town dealer
to competitors who throve at his expense on illegal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
profits; but it was probably the governing body
of the town which maintained the most serious
opposition to all traffic that depended on the
cheating of the common treasury of the borough.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
For no trifling part of the town revenue came,
as we see from the Nottingham records, from
fines paid yearly by non-freemen for the privilege
of holding a stall in street or market. In Canterbury
“Tollerati” paid for the right of buying and selling
during a limited period, and at the end of the time
renewed the right by a fresh payment of what was
called “Tolleration money”;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> alien traders living
without the liberties, there known as “intrantes,”
took in Romney the name of “extravagantes.”
Some towns shewed a jealousy of strangers, dictated
no doubt by special circumstances; as in Preston,
where the “Foreign Burgesses,” as distinguished
from the “Inn Burgesses,” were drawn from the
country gentry and squires and some inhabitants
of the town,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and were merely freed from toll<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> for
any goods bought for the use of their families, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
were allowed no other profits of trade, and even
though they were inhabitants had no right of common
on marsh or moor, nor could they join in the
election of any town officer nor be themselves
elected;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> while even with these restrictions no
trader who lived outside the walls was admitted
among them,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and it was only in course of time
that alien dealers were gradually allowed on payment
of a fine to set up stalls in the market-place
and carry on their business under the name of
“stallingers.” In general, however, an open purse
was all that was needed to commend a stranger; and
if the charge on it was sometimes excessive it seems
to have been enforced mainly as a means of persuasion
to enter the Merchant Guild.</p>

<p>But for whatever reason the regulation of trade was
thought desirable, whether to protect the consumer’s
pocket or to fill the town treasury, it certainly was
not intended to keep buyers and sellers at home, to
hamper their enterprise, or to abolish competition.
If protection and monopoly were allowed to look big,
they were never allowed to get seriously in the way
of business. In theory and sometimes in fact iron
chains might be flung across the King’s highway,
bars thrown athwart the river, and custom house
officers set at the gate to levy toll and stallage.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
But gates and bars and chains swung open everywhere
before the trader “if he have the penny ready
to take to;” the guilds enlarged their rolls for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
foreigners,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> the towns granted them their privileges
liberally. Since a man could hold citizenship in more
than one borough a speculator or merchant doing
business in a large way might always circumvent the
rules against foreign dealers by being made citizen
in some convenient trading centre as well as in his
own town,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and so obtain power to carry on the
business proper to an alien speculator with all the
privileges of a resident burgher. Every pedantic
hindrance, indeed, was removed out of the way of his
enterprise, for a very slight study of town records
disposes of the idea that mediæval trade was
ultimately governed by the formal laws of statute
books. Monopoly was broken through whenever it
was advisable or convenient for special occasions.
Bakers and victuallers who rose to municipal offices
turned the assize of bread and the inspection of cooking
houses and fish stalls into an idle tale. In the hands
of merchants the laws of buying and selling were
manipulated so as to interfere neither with the free
circulation of goods nor with the instinct of the dealer
to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the
dearest; and it was still left possible to carry
food where it was most needed, whether to supply
a manufacturing centre such as Norwich or a city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
which was rapidly doubling its population like
London.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> If the law ordained that the forestaller was
to be heavily fined for the first offence; for the
second to lose his merchandise and be put in
the pillory; and for the third to be deprived of the
freedom of the city, the law was simply ignored, or
some trifling fine was inflicted&mdash;a paltry sum which
a prosperous trader might easily disregard.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In
fact it would almost seem that the actual
result of the trade laws was mainly to give the
rich wholesale merchant an additional advantage
over the poor trader. Forestalling and regrating
became the fashionable privilege of town councillors
and magnates who through their position and
their wealth found it doubly easy to evade local
ordinances, of London merchants who were buying
all over the country to supply the needs of the
growing city, and of dealers on a large scale interested
in the export trade; while the terrors of the law
served as an effective deterrent to struggling hawkers
and chapmen against meddling with the profits won
by more exalted speculators from a customary if
illegal traffic.</p>

<p>The real foundation of free trade throughout the
country, however, and that which alone gave any
value to local arrangements and individual privileges,
is to be found in the early town charters, where this
great gift had a leading place. Almost the first boon
asked for by a borough was a grant which should make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
its burghers or its merchant guild quit of tolls and
pontage, and stallage and lastage, throughout the whole
kingdom, in fairs and throughout sea-ports, in lands
on this and on the other side of the sea; and
give them power to buy and sell throughout
all England, within cities and without, all kinds
of merchandise; with the right to have stalls
in other markets than their own without paying
stallage, and to buy in such markets at all hours and
not only those allowed to strangers. Each charter
moreover had wrapped up in it a kind of “favoured
nation” clause which gave to boroughs “such liberties
as the city of London hath”&mdash;a clause which seems
to have been interpreted (at least as to one of its
meanings) as implying the right for burghers to buy
and sell in gross in another town than their own on
other than market days, and that “they may have in
this respect as much liberty as the citizens of
London.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In its wide and unstinted privileges a charter such
as this&mdash;the grant of a king who was lord of all
fairs and markets&mdash;expressed the whole spirit of free
trade; at a word local monopoly and protection in
its true sense were swept away, and every market in
the country opened to any trader duly enrolled as a
burgher or a member of the Merchant Guild. The
question indeed still bristled with difficulties. As the
king was constantly giving away or selling his rights,
or part of his rights, over markets, there were
innumerable cases when the special grant to one
town to hold a market without disturbance, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
more general license to its neighbour to consider
itself free of all market dues, were wholly irreconcilable;
and the law held that no charter of
freedom could interfere with any earlier rights
granted to any other person or corporation to levy
tolls on transport, on crossing a bridge, on entering a
gate, on taking up a standing in the market, or the
like. In cases where two charters were found to
bestow conflicting rights, therefore, the towns set
their best lawyers to search out old evidences and
records, and to claim the protection of judges of the
King’s Bench or of Parliament for the grant that
boasted of the greater age.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The preliminary question
of priority of rights having been thus decided, the
next step was to remedy the dead-lock of business
to which the two communities had been brought by
means of formal treaties such as nations make to-day,
in which the right to levy toll and custom was probably
used as systems of tariffs have been used in
modern states&mdash;as a means of bribing or threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
refractory neighbours into some concession of free
trade.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Southampton made its separate treaties
with at least seventy-three towns or trading corporations
besides all the “honours” of the kingdom,
releasing them from payment of its tolls and customs;
its burghers had their own compact with Marlborough<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
in which they waived such privileges as they possessed
by their own earlier charter; with Bristol they settled
the amount of the tax to be levied on Bristol men
who brought merchandise to their market; they
agreed with the men of Winchester that no tolls
should be asked on either side;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and in 1501 their
treaty with the Cinque Ports was ratified by “your
lovers the bailiff and jurats of Hastings.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Undermined
as they were on all sides, and with gaping
breaches everywhere, the walls of protection which
the boroughs had thrown up round their markets
certainly formed no impediment to the movement
of local trade. Before the impatience of traders
greedy for gain, artificial frontiers and barriers and
tariffs were swept away, and from little self-contained
communities where the cottagers grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
their own food and spun their own wool and asked
scarcely anything from outside save fish and salt and
a little iron, the boroughs grew rapidly into centres of
expanding commerce. To supply their needs or
their luxuries they despatched their traders far
and wide. When Ely sent for John of Gloucester,
the famous bell-founder, to make the four great bells
for the cathedral, messengers had to go to Erith for
clay, and to Lynn and Northampton for copper and
tin.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The Nottingham goldsmith was employed to
repair the cross in Clifton Church, and its “alablaster
man” supplied the faithful in London with little
statues of the Baptist in appropriate shrines.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Buyers of wool and sellers of cloth, saddlers, butchers,
fishmongers, hawkers of all sorts, obtained from the
mayor and commonalty of their borough letters of
free passage throughout the kingdom for the carrying
on of their business<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and kept up incessant intercourse
between town and town. Everywhere busy
forestallers were on the look out for eggs and meat
and corn, and bought up supplies all over the country
for London or some big town or for the export
trade, or turned their privileges under the clause of
London liberties into a means of buying wholesale
all the week long as regrators in order to sell at a
profit on market day, while on that day itself they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
were out at cock-crow to buy privately when the
citizens were at mass, so that by six o’clock there was
nothing left in the market for the good folk of the
town.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>As we look at this mighty volume of commerce
pouring from town to town with a steady force that
swept all obstacles out of its channel, we may well
begin to doubt whether the burghers of the middle
ages were indeed stupidly putting their necks under
a hard yoke of arbitrary law, and wilfully destroying
their own prospects by preferring bondage to freedom,
or sacrificing general prosperity to local greeds.
The mediæval system, until it began to fall into
the decay that precedes death, was in fact the minister
to fine and worthy ends. In a society where
few rights existed save by way of privilege, the
trading “communitas,” whether the borough or the
guild, did actually serve as the great engine for the
abolition of restrictions, for extending privilege, and
throwing open a national commerce. There was a time
when every new chartered association was an actual
widening of free trade; and a man entered the community
of a town for the same reasons that he might
to-day take out letters of naturalization in a country
where his business lay&mdash;not to be ensured against
competition, but to share in all commercial privileges
which it had won by treaty, and in case of peril to
own the protection of its flag. Each town had its
own privileged “community” and recognized the
“community” of the neighbouring borough; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was by this mutual recognition only that intermunicipal
treaties became possible, or that any
borough could ascertain the limits of its responsibility
for members in foreign fair or market, could pledge
itself to the fulfilment of its treaties, or have any
guarantee for redress in case of wrong.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In the
detailed municipal legislation about debt and surety
and mutual responsibility, about punishment of
violence, the suppression of an individual traitor
to the common weal, the protection of a community
from false dealing of any of its confederate states, we
may plainly see how local monopolies had come to be
far more significant from the point of view of
public order and general intercourse than of private
wealth. Monopoly and protection in fact had put on
the garb of a necessary office and service. Instead of
gaolers who kept the trader fast bound at home, they
were the strong guardians who attended him as he
went abroad, the fore-runners who cut down before
him the chains that barred the highway, the ministers
of justice that tracked out in his service the fraudulent
debtor, the pledges to him in every danger of
the vigilance and power of his native town. To each
community they were the bonds of a civil order and
the tokens of a corporate fidelity.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWN TRADER</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the appearance of the new commercial society
in the boroughs we feel that the history of modern
England has begun. By the formation of a prosperous
middle class, a new type of character was
introduced into English life&mdash;a type which lay
altogether outside old traditions, and was as far from
imitating the confident superiority of classes that held
the mastery by traditional right, as it was from preserving
the simplicity and resignation of the masses
of those who confessed a hereditary duty of subjection.
The mediæval burgher was trained in a rough school.
Owing nothing to class or family or patron, roughly
judged and consigned to his own place in the ranks
by the test of competition in its simplest form, the
industrial rivalry between man and man, the trader
had no helper if he did not help himself. Merchants
burdened with little capital, like the trader
pictured by Holbein in his Dance of Death carrying
all their store of wealth bound up on their persons,
and free to change their residence as often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as commerce offered brighter prospects elsewhere,
wandered from town to town, leaving no trade
unlearned, no fair unvisited at home, and no market
forgotten abroad. Craftmasters equally destitute of
money had to trust to their own wit in the struggle
for life, and became practised in vigilance and
patience, thrift and caution, in the contempt of hardship,
in strenuous and ceaseless activity. The
discipline of trade was severe, and the conditions
of prosperity hard. If a gentleman intruder appeared
among these men hoping to find an easy way to
wealth in the more respectable forms of business to
which the county families alone condescended, his
experiences were watched with contemptuous good
humour by the burghers, who knew the hardships
of the road.</p>

<p class="pp8q">“I have made many a knight both mercer and draper,”</p>

<p class="pn1">says the merchant in a mediæval poem,</p>

<p class="pp4q p1">“Paid never for their prenticehood not a pair of gloves;<br />
But chaffered with my chevesance, [bargains] cheved [prospered] seldom after.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">The feeble and incompetent fell away before the
severity of the tests applied, and the trading class
was constantly undergoing change. Perhaps some
sturdy Jewish stock, like the Phillips of Birmingham,
held their own for three or four centuries;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
more commonly families spring up into importance
and for one or two generations hold the first place
in the payment of taxes, and have control of
the chief offices of government, till after the third
generation the name disappears from the account
books.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The family has died out, or broken down
under the stress of competition, or it has settled
upon an estate bought in the country and become
merged among the county squires; and some new
stock comes in to fight its way with fresh energy and
enterprise.</p>

<p>In picturing to ourselves the life of a mediæval
borough it sometimes happens that, with our constant
tendency to exaggerate the strangeness of the
past, we perceive only an existence so straitened and
humble in condition that all sense of distinctions is
lost, and we create a false monotony, supposing that
because in that remote world business was carried on
in a narrow sphere men’s fortunes were therefore
more equal, or that the general level of commercial
prosperity was necessarily more uniform than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
now. But everything we know of town life, from
the moment when the boroughs come into view,
forces home the conviction of an inequality of circumstance
and wealth as sensible as any that we recognize
in the later Middle Ages; of a society which was at
no time either simple or homogeneous, and where the
plutocrat and capitalist held as imposing a place and
bore himself in as lordly a fashion, considering the
limits of his stage, as his descendants of modern times.
The secret of wealth was first found, as it was long
kept, by the butchers, brewers, and victuallers of one
kind or another. There were in every borough men
like Andrew Bate, the butcher of Lydd, who became
“farmer of Dengemarsh,” and kept the town in a
ferment for years, whether with his herds of cattle
which overran the marsh pastures and trespassed on
his neighbours’ fields or commons so that they could
not “occupy in peace,” and would rather sell their
land than be so “grievously hurted by the cattle of
Andrew Bate;” or with his heavy tolls for the
“Western men” who came to dry their whiting on
the nesse, and found him a hard “extortioner” who
“had driven away half Dengemarsh”; above all with
his ceaseless activity in extending his borders over the
doubtful limits that parted the lands of the town from
the lands of the Abbot; so that though the corporation
in 1462 insisted on a careful marking out of their
frontiers, and years later were labouring to have
him supplanted in Dengemarsh by another burgher,
Bate was evidently victorious, and ended by seeing
his brother, who had been trained in the law probably
with this object, appointed Town Clerk and practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
controller of the affairs of Lydd.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> In like manner the
rich fishmonger, Daniel Rowe of Romney, who sent his
oysters, crabs, lampreys, and trout to London, the
eastern counties, Cambridge, and along the valley
of the Thames as far as Wallingford, and fetched
back in their stead boars, calves, porkers, and bacon,
ended by being made Town Clerk of Romney<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>&mdash;as
indeed became an educated man, who kept his daybooks,
where all the travelling expenses of men and
horses were carefully set down, in Latin. So also the
Romney vintner, James Tyece, who began life in a very
small way in 1387, was important enough in 1394
to be sent on a deputation to the archbishop; in 1398
he was Jurat, and in 1414 held so much land that
his property was made into a separate ward named
after him in 1432.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>In short in every town the bakers, brewers,
vintners, cooks, hostellers, and publicans “built their
nests high” buying burgages out of the pence of the
poor,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and in spite of law and ordinance walked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
streets in the furred mantles of aldermen, entered the
council chamber, kept the treasure chest as chamberlains&mdash;issuing
prudent versions of the town accounts
calculated for the public eye, and themselves regulating
the assessments for taxes in the interests of
their wealthy fellowship&mdash;and presided over the
courts of justice, where they administered the assizes
of bread and beer for the benefit of the fraternity;
while for their services they required a part of the
common land to be enclosed for their use, or
pastured their flocks at the public expense, and
in a thousand ways gathered in for generations the
harvest that then ripened for men in authority.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
No law could shut them out from the mayor’s
seat; and carrying away from office the robe of
“clean scarlet” which gave them the chief places
among the powerful members of “the Clothing,”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
they still dominated over a helpless people, with
scarcely any check save from the jealousy of their
fellow traders. Thus all Canterbury was disturbed in
1507 by the brewer Crompe who, having been mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for a year, returned to his former business on leaving
office, and went about busily canvassing the small
retailers, promising that if they would sell Crompe’s
beer he would be their “very good master whatsoever
they had to do in the Court Hall,” and that he
would see to it that their pots should not be carried
off on charges of short measure to the Hall. In cases
of this kind remonstrance from the people seems
invariably to have been perfectly useless, and the only
complaint recorded in Canterbury was that of the
rival brewers, who met Crompe’s competition by
an appeal to a custom of the town that the mayor
should altogether forsake the victualling trades; in
the course of the half century there had been, it was
said, at least six mayors who had “lived like gentlemen”
for the rest of their lives after leaving office,
and though this polite profession allowed them to
carry on the business of drapers or cloth manufacturers,
it was proved that one ex-mayor who had been a
brewer as well as draper left off his brewery and
never returned to it; while another who was a baker
sold his business, hired his house to another man,
and “lived after as a gentleman.” Crompe however
remained obstinate, contemptuously protesting that
the alleged “custom” was but fifty years old (a bit
of special pleading on his part since this was just the
age of the mayoralty itself in Canterbury) and, that
the mayors had ceased to be victuallers out of self-indulgence,
and because they preferred to live at their
ease.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>At the first victuallers and publicans owed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
supremacy in the town society to the fact that among
a people needy and thrifty the trader’s only way to
fortune lay in selling the common necessaries of life.
The great bulk of the people lived poorly. In
general perhaps the master craftsman scarcely earned
a higher wage than his journeymen,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and may have
often eked out his livelihood by ploughing and
reaping his lot of the common land at one time,
while at another he worked at his occupation with
two or three helpers&mdash;servants and apprentices
“which be of no great having,” and who were
by law compelled to cut, gather, and bring in the
corn<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> if they were employed in a trade “of which
craft or mystery a man hath no great need in
harvest time.” The first speculators who were tempted
by visions of a great public with its exhaustless needs
and unfathomable purse pursued their dreams with
the guile of petty schemers. If a dealer proposed
to make his fortune in malt he opened proceedings
with the strictest economies. A penny
or a half-penny served as earnest money to the
peasants from whom he bought his corn, and who
were told to come to the house for payment. “And
when they come there and think to have their
payment directly, the buyer says that his wife at
his house has gone out, and has taken the key
of the room, so that he cannot get at his money;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
but that the other must go away and come again
soon and receive his pay. And when he comes back
a second time, then the buyer is not to be found;
or else, if he is found, he feigns something else, by
reason whereof the poor men cannot have their
pay. And sometimes while the poor men are waiting
for their pay the buyer causes the corn to be
wetted,” and then tells the peasant he may take it
away with him if he does not like the price offered.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
In the same way the cloth contractor started with a
modest business that needed no outlay of money,
taking the raw material which his customers brought
to him and handing it over to weavers, who on their
side provided their own tools and did the work in
their own homes. As he prospered in the world he
may have become the owner of a few looms which
he let out to the weavers he employed; or he perhaps
added to his trade the keeping of a little shop or
some small pedlar’s business for the sake of such
petty gains as the law, looking in those days with
scant favour on dealers, might allow. Often hard
set to carry on his business, he sought to help out
his poverty by cunning, and the expedients to which
he was driven&mdash;the giving out of bad material or
short weight to his workmen, the devices to save a
few pence here and there by deducting it on one
pretext or another from payments due, the giving
wages in victuals or needles or mercery or the waste
trifles of his little shop&mdash;must often indicate the distracting
pressure of immediate need under which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
anticipated the devices of the small working employer
of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>But from the earliest times it is evident that there
were many of the more successful traders who rose to
a position which, in a humbler degree, closely resembles
that of our modern capitalists and employers,
and that this class constantly tended to increase in
wealth and in numbers. They evidently rivalled in
astuteness their brethren of lowlier fortunes.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Ne had the grace of guile gone among my ware<br />
It had been unsold this seven year, so me God help,”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">the merchant in Piers Ploughman admits frankly.
His wife who made the cloth for sale was diligent
in her sphere of economies, ordering her spinning
women to spin the yarn out to great length, and
paying for it by a pound measure that weighed a
quarter more than her husband’s weighing machine&mdash;when
he weighed true. At the draper’s he was
taught how to stretch out the list of the cloth, or to
fasten rich pieces together with a pack needle, and
lengthen them out with pressers till ten or twelve
yards reached to thirteen; and to get rid of his goods
at Winchester and Wayhill fairs he carefully learned
to lie and use false weights. To add to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
resources he would go to the Lombards for lessons
in clipping coin and in lending money out at usury.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Weaknesses of remorse troubled him little.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“‘Repentedst thou never?’ quoth Repentance, ‘nor restitution madest?’<br />
‘Yea, once,’ quoth he, ‘I was y harboured with a heap of chapmen,<br />
I arose and rifled their mails when they a’rest were.’<br />
‘That was a rueful restitution,’ quoth Repentance, ‘forsooth!’”</p>

<p class="p1">No age, indeed, has a monopoly of clever dealers,
and every artifice practised in earlier days was
familiar to the fifteenth century, and so loudly resented
by the consumers, that many people, mistaking
the signs of a public zeal to check abuses for the
evidences of a growing audacity in evil, have discovered
in the later middle ages an accumulating mass
of corruption which gradually covered with its blackness
the felicity of a purer age.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> But whether from
“the grace of guile,” or from sheer ability, the
traders prospered on every side. Langland looking
out over all classes of men sees how with them above
all lay the secret of fatness and good cheer:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And some chose chaffer, they cheved [prospered] the better,<br />
As it seemeth to our sight that such man thriveth.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The large sums that passed from hand to hand&mdash;the
imposing debts registered in the town accounts&mdash;the
complaints of a master being in arrears to his
apprentice for a sum of £100, or an apprentice to
his master for £138&mdash;the leasing out of the customs
of a great port like Southampton to a single merchant&mdash;all
these things indicate the new plutocracy
that was beginning to appear.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Drapers and clothiers
were admitted into the select circles of privilege; in
the towns the rank of “gentleman” became the
appropriate reward of a successful cloth merchant,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and even in the county society the clothier was
beginning to oust the old proprietors. The Tames
of Gloucestershire were ordinary dealers who made
cloth and traded at Cirencester till about 1480 when
John Tame rented great tracts of land at Fairford for
his flocks of sheep, and in the new industrial centre
which he developed there, wool was collected to feed
the Cirencester manufactory. All over the country
he bought at a cheap rate lands which the ruined
nobles could no longer hold; and his enormous wealth
increased yet further under his son Edmund, who
took his place among the “gentry” by becoming High
Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1505, receiving the
reward of knighthood in 1516, and entertaining
Henry the Eighth at his house at Fairford in 1520.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The most wealthy folk in the towns, however, were
probably the class that had grown up with the developement
of foreign commerce and the export trade<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>&mdash;the
merchants who forsook handicrafts and lived
wholly by “grete aventour.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Their lot was not
altogether an easy one in a society perplexed by
the mighty rush of the new commerce, where men
trained in an earlier system looked with a
mixture of fear and dislike on the intrusion of a
dubious profession not vouched for by familiar
custom&mdash;“covetous people who seek their own advantage,”
and who not only lay under suspicion as
men who refused to work, but were reproached with
the destruction of trade by underselling the goods of
English artizans with cheaper foreign wares. The
government was concerned lest by their dealings the
merchants should diminish the stock of gold to be
kept in the country;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> while, on the other hand, Church
and people unanimously saw in bargains with bills
and pledges and sums bearing interest, which were
then known as “dry exchange,” something not to be
distinguished from the sin of usury, and called on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
government to declare void all such “damnable
bargains grounded in usury, coloured by the name of
new chevesaunce contrary to the law of natural
justice”&mdash;“corrupt bargains which be most usually
had within cities and boroughs.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> To the delicate conscience
of theologian or social preacher trade could
only be defended on the ground that honestly conducted
it made no profit.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> As for the “poor commons,”
they held that while a man might live by trading,
and perhaps make a modest competence, he had no
right to grow rich;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> his gains represented to the people
the wages of iniquity, and the hungry toiler sitting
over his mess of beans and bacon-rind comforted himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as best he could with thoughts of the weary ages
merchants must at last count in purgatory, watching
kings and knights and bishops pass out of its gates,
while they themselves still lingered to pay the penalty
of great oaths and innumerable taken</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Against clean conscience, for covetyse of winning.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">Meanwhile their way was made difficult on earth,
and along the road to fair or market the wandering
merchant or chapman was held to ransom by the
rustics, while the harmless messenger who travelled
by his side was sent merrily on his road.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>To the mediæval mind indeed the merchant burdened
with his goods was the very type of the soul
laden with sins, and painfully battling its doubtful
way to heaven. He passed from peril to peril in the
transport of the packages on which he had set the
sign that distinguished his wares, the tall cross with
shrouds<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> or the flag. No navy protected his vessels
on seas that swarmed with pirates, and companies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ships as ready for battle as for commerce, set out
together, under command of one of the captains
chosen as admiral,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> to fight their way as best they
could, while at home fear beset the owner on every
side. If a merchant sent his servant over sea to
Bruges, or despatched an apprentice to one of the
Baltic ports to gather in the profits due to him or
to carry merchandise, no man might comfort him,
and no religious thought distract his spirit till his
messengers returned;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and even when his goods
reached port all his experience and cunning were
needed to deal with the exactions of the king, who
demanded the first choice of his wine or precious
cargo, or to baffle the rapacity of the officers of the
sheriff, the officers of the staple, the collectors of
customs, the treasurers of the town, the searchers, or
the clerk of the market.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>If, however, the risks of the merchant who dared
the “great adventure” increased a hundredfold, so
the chances open to courage and skill became more
brilliant,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and the triumphant trader became the object
of national pride. London had its hero&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">“The son</p>

<p class="p1">A brass in the church of Chipping Camden, dated

prosperity of the Hawleys<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> was recalled in the

<p class="pn1">There were none who surpassed the merchants of
Bristol&mdash;men who had made of their town the chief
depot for the wine trade of southern France, a staple
for leather, lead, and tin, the great mart for the fish
of the Channel and for the salt trade of Brittany,
whose cloth and leather were carried to Denmark
to be exchanged for stock-fish, and to France and
Spain for wine; who as early as 1420 made their way
by compass to Iceland; whose vessels were the first
from England to enter the Levant; and who when
calamity fell on their business by the loss of Bordeaux,
and by the competition of London merchants and the
concentration of commerce in the hands of its Adventurers,
turned their faces to the New World; sending
out in 1480, and year after year from that time,
two, three, or four light ships to sail “west of Ireland”
in search of the “Island of Brasylle and the seven
Cities,” till in 1496 Cabot started with five vessels on
his voyage of discovery, whence he came back to live
in great honour among his fellow-townsmen, dressing
in silk, and known as the “Great Admiral.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Bristol merchants of those days lived splendidly
in fine houses three stories high, the grander
ones having each its own tower. Underground
stretched vast cellars with groined stone roofs: the
ground floor was a warehouse or shop opening to
the street; above this were the parlour and bedroom,
with attics in the gables; while the great hall was
built out behind with a lofty roof of carved timber.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
In the towers treasures of plate were stored which
rivalled those of the nobles, and the walls were hung
with the richest tapestries, or with at least “counterfeit
Arras.” Perhaps it was some such house which
suggested to the poet, born perhaps in a village
“cote,” and who knew Bristol well, the idea of an
abode which might be offered to the Lord of
heaven&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Neither in cot neither in caitiff house was Christ y bore,<br />

<p class="p1">But the growing luxury of private life is a far less
striking feature of the mediæval borough than the
splendid tradition of civic patriotism and generosity
which seems to have prevailed. Burghers who
prospered in the world left their noblest records in
the memories of their public munificence; and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
were hundreds of benefactors like Thomas Elys, the
Sandwich draper, who in 1392 founded the hospital
of S. Thomas-the-Martyr, and endowed it with a
messuage and 132 acres of land; and within five
months after founded the chantry of S. Thomas-the-Martyr;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
or like Simon Grendon, three times mayor
of Exeter, who left money to found a hospital for the
poor. Gifts to churches of plate and vestments
and books, legacies for chantries or for priests are
too numerous to mention;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> but there was a steady
tendency among the townspeople to turn their benefactions
into very different channels, and bequeathing
their money to the town corporation instead of a
religious body, to devote it directly to secular purposes
and charities of the new fashion&mdash;founding free
schools, building walls, repairing bridges, maintaining
harbours for their borough, or leaving a fund for the
payment of the ferm rent or certain fixed taxes. An
Abingdon merchant gave a thousand marks towards
the bridges over the two dangerous fords, Borough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Ford and Culham Ford, which had to be built
by the Abingdon men “at their own cost and
charges, the alms of the town, and the benevolence
of well-disposed persons,” and which were to
make Abingdon the high road from Gloucester to
London.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In 1421, when the Friars who owned the
sources from which Southampton had its supply of
water could no longer afford to replace the decayed
pipes, a burgher “for the good of his soul” left money
for new leaden pipes sufficient for the whole town as
well as for the friars.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> An Ipswich burgess gave the

always forthcoming for gates and walls and market

while as we have seen, a new system of education
was practically founded by the free schools which
were so largely endowed by their liberality.</p>

<p>For the first time in fact since the expulsion of the
Jews from England we find a class of men with money
to dispose of; for whatever gold and silver was
available for practical purposes was gathered into the
coffers of the burghers. The noble “wasters” who
with gluttony destroyed what plougher and sower
won<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> carried a light purse; while timid country-folk,
terrified by the disorder and insecurity of the times,
unused to commerce and speculation, buried their
treasures in the earth, or laid away bags of “old
nobles” with their plate in safe hiding places,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
industriously hoarding against the evil day that
haunted their imagination. But among spendthrifts
and faint-hearted economists the burghers came
with habits of large winnings and generous outgoings.
They became the usurers and money-lenders
of the age. When the county families had exhausted
all possibilities of borrowing from their cousins
and neighbours<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> they had to turn to the shopkeepers
of the nearest town, who seem to have been
willing to make special and private arrangements on
better terms than those of the common usurer.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> John
Paston borrowed from the sheriff of London; Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
William Parr pawned his plate to a London fishmonger
for £120, which he was to pay over to him
in the church of S. Mary-on-the-Hill beside Billingsgate.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
From Richard the Second onwards kings
borrowed as readily as their subjects from the
drapers and mercers of the towns. The prosperous
merchant in his prouder moments matched his substantial
merits against the haughty pretensions of
lords who could go about begging of burgesses in
towns and be “not the better of a bean though they
borrow ever,”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and was not without an occasional
touch of disdain for aristocratic poverty. Sir
William Plumpton married the daughter of a citizen
and merchant of York, who out of her rich dowry
of houses in Ripon and York was able to leave large
fortunes to her children. One of these wrote a description
of a visit she paid to the house of some aristocratic
cousins, Sir John Scrope and his daughter
Mistress Darcy, and of their supercilious bearing. “By
my troth I stood there a large hour, and yet I might
neither see Lord nor Lady ... and yet I had five
men in a suit (of livery). There is no such five men
in <i>his</i> house, I dare say.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>But the constant fusion of classes which went on
steadily throughout the century showed how solid
were the reasons which drew together the rich traders of
the towns and the half bankrupt families of the county.
Impoverished country gentry were tempted by the
money made in business, just as the “merchants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
new gentlemen” hoped to reach distinction by marriage
into landed families. Squires built for themselves
houses in the neighbouring boroughs, turned
into traders on their own account, and commonly took
office at last in the municipal government;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> while
on the other hand successful city merchants were
becoming landed proprietors all over the country, were
decorated with the ornaments of the Bath, and distinguished
by fashionable marriages,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> in spite of the
fretful sarcasms of a “gentle” class consoled in the
hard necessities of poverty by a faint pride. “Merchants
or new gentlemen I deem will proffer large,”
Edmund Paston wrote when a marriage of one of
his family was in question; “well I wot if ye
depart to London ye shall have proffers large.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
seems to have preferred that the Pastons should look
out for good connections; and possibly this anxiety
was especially present in the case of the women, for
the family seem to have been rather excited when
Margery Paston in 1449 married one Richard Calle,
and went, as John said, “to sell candles and mustard
in Framlingham.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> But John Paston felt no
hesitation about marrying the daughter of a London
draper. One brother considered the solid merits of
a London mercer’s daughter, and another was very
anxious to secure as his wife the widow of a worsted
merchant at Worstead, who had been left a hundred
marks in money, a hundred marks in plate and furniture,
and £10 a year in land.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The money side of
marriage with a substantial burgher must have had
its attractive side also to the county ladies. In Nottingham,
according to the “custom of the English
borough,” half of the property of the husband passed
at his death to his widow;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and a London mercer
setting up in business promises in his contract of
marriage “to find surety that if he die she to have
£100 besides her part of his goods after the custom
of the city.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>All interests in fact conspired in effacing class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
distinctions to an extent unknown in European countries;
and in a land where “new men” had long been
recognized among the king’s greatest officials, and where
law created no barriers in social life, all roads to eminence
lay open before the adventurer. Notwithstanding
this freedom, however, the English merchant never rose
to the same height of wealth and power as the great
traders of the Continent. We have no such figures
as that of Jacques Cœur,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> burgher of Bourges, whose
ships were to be seen in England carrying martens
and sables and cloth of gold; or trading up the
Rhone; or competing with rivals from Genoa, Venice,
and Catalonia for the coasting trade of the Mediterranean;
or sailing to the Levant, each vessel laden
with sixteen or twenty thousand ducats for trade
adventures. Three hundred agents in various towns
acted as his factors in business; and his ambassadors
were to be found at the court of the Egyptian Sultan,
or sitting as arbitrators in the quarrels of political
parties in Genoa. “I know,” he writes with frank
consciousness of power, “that the winning of the San
Grail cannot be done without me.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He had bought
more than twenty estates or lordships, had two houses
at Paris, two at Tours, four houses and two hotels at
Lyons, houses at Beaucaire, Béziers, Narbonne, S.
Pourçain, Marseilles, Montpellier, Perpignan, and
Bourges. In 1450 he had spent 100,000 crowns of
gold on the new house he was building out of Roman
remains at Bourges, and it was still unfinished. As
Master of the Mint at Bourges and at Paris, and as
the greatest capitalist of his nation, he practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
controlled the whole finances of France; and, indeed,
held in his hands the fortunes of French commerce,
and even of the French nation, for it was his loans
to the King that alone enabled Charles to drive the
English out of Normandy. At a time when all trade
was strictly forbidden to the noble class, a grateful
monarch, mindful of timely loans and of jewels redeemed
from pawn by his useful money-lender, ennobled
Jacques Cœur, with his wife and children. His eldest
son was Archbishop of Bourges; his brother was Bishop
of Luçon; his nephew and chief factor was Councillor
of King Réné, and Chamberlain of the Duke of
Calabria. But just as far as he went beyond the
English trader in his glory and success, so far he
exceeded him in the greatness of his ruin. The same
arbitrary power which had set him above his fellows
could as easily be used to cast him down; and after
twenty years of prosperity Jacques Cœur was a State
prisoner, robbed of all his goods, and condemned to
perpetual exile. Transforming banishment into
opportunity for new ventures, he set off eastward at
the head of a crusade in 1456 to die on the journey,
and find a grave in Chios.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Beside such a career as this, and measured by the
prizes that hung before the adventurers of the Continent,
the life of the English trader was indeed homely
and monotonous. Triumph and ruin alike were on a
modest scale. No great figure stands out from the rest
as the associate of princes or the political agent of
kings. No name has come down to us glorified by a
vast ambition, or dignified by an intellectual inspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
or made famous for turning the balance of a
political situation. And it is just in this fact that
we discover the essential character of the new commercial
society in England. Instead of colossal fortunes
we find a large middle class enjoying everywhere
without fear a solid and substantial comfort.
And, perhaps as a consequence of the widespread
diffusion of material prosperity, the republic of
traders had succeeded in developing a marvellous
art of organization, with all its necessary discipline.
The triumphs of the English merchants were won
by a solid phalanx of men alike endowed with good
average capacity, possessing extraordinary gifts of
endurance and genius for combination, and moving
all together with irresistible determination to their
ends. The uniformity and regularity of their ranks
was never broken by the intrusion of a leader of
genius pre-eminent among his fellows; and whether
in towns or in commercial fraternities, the little
despotisms that were set up were despotisms, not
of a single master, but of groups of men who had devised
a common policy and by whose voluntary and
united efforts it was sustained. In fact the very
spirit of the people seemed to have entered into the
great industrial system which had sprung up in their
midst&mdash;a growth free and independent, nourished out
of the common soil from which it came, obedient to
its own laws, expanding by the force of its own
nature.</p>

<p>No doubt there was loss as well as gain for a
society so constituted. The special genius of the
people, their remoteness from outer influences, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
concentration of the national forces on the pressing
industrial and commercial problems of the moment;
all these things evidently affected the developement
of the national life, and tended in many ways to
leave civilization still rude and imperfect. But in
addition to this we are also conscious of the influence
of a certain prevailing mediocrity of station. The
horizon of the trading and industrial classes was
bounded by a practical materialism where intellect had
as little play as imagination. Neither the glamour of
ancient Rome nor the romance of a crusade ever
touched the fancy of an English merchant, busy with
the problems of the hour. There is no stately dwelling
of those days to show the magnificent conceptions
which might occupy a merchant builder, and a
“palace of King John” at Nottingham,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> or a turreted
house at Bristol, “the best of all the town,” telling
their tale of a comfortable domesticity, contrast
strangely with the famous building of Bourges. So
far as we know no trader or burgher possessed a
library; out of the lost past not so much as a line of
Horace found an echo among even the more lettered
men of business till over a hundred years later;
not a picture was carried home from the schools of
Italy or the Netherlands; of the mighty commerce
of the world beyond the sea the trader knew everything,
of its culture nothing; and England remained
without any distinguished patrons of the arts or
fosterers of learning save those found in bishops’
palaces. And not only was the trader limited on the
side of art and letters; in the hurry of business he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had no time and less attention to give to political
problems that lay beyond his own parish or his industrial
domain. Fortunately for his country he
reaped an exact reward. His business prospered, but
the work of statesmanship in its finer sense was given
to others; and in the political and commercial crises
through which England had to pass she for a time
chose her leaders from men trained in another and
more comprehensive school. It was only in the next
century that the merchant by degrees began to enter
on a new dominion in the world of politics. Under
the early Tudors it became the custom to appoint
as representatives of England in foreign countries
traders resident in the place, and though the system
is commonly put down to the niggardliness of the
Court, it was more probably due to the ruler’s sagacity.
In England itself it was with Thomas Cromwell,
the clerk of Antwerp, the wool merchant of Middelburg,
scrivener, banker, and attorney, that for the
first time the man of business made his vigorous entry
into the Court, struck aside at a blow the venerable
traditions that had gathered there round Church
and State, and from the wreck and ruin of the past
proclaimed the triumph of a new age.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LABOUR QUESTION</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> no complaint is at first sight so startling
amid the vigorous growth of manufacture and commerce
which marked the fifteenth century, and in
a society where pestilence and plague apparently kept
population stationary, as the complaint of surplus
labour; and the elusive way in which the problem
appears and vanishes again makes it yet more bewildering.
People complained at one moment of
labourers unemployed, and at the next they modified
old laws because they could not get workmen enough.
Masters on all sides were evading the regulations
which limited the number of their apprentices and
journeymen, and still cried to the State for protection
for their craft because the artizan could find no work
to do. Men talked of foreign competition and too
many workers in every trade, and took forcible
measures to keep down prices and wages. The lawmakers
were forbidding the import of foreign goods so
as to give employment to destitute artizans at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and the artizans were conspiring to limit their output
and raise their prices. That there was some real
trouble whose indeterminate presence can be felt
behind all these conflicting appearances we cannot
doubt; but it may be questioned whether the trouble
was that of labour for which there was no demand.</p>

<p>Many of the complaints no doubt arose in some
period of peculiar suffering, when an outbreak of war
or the rivalry between England and the Netherlands
shut the great markets across the sea, and left
weavers with idle looms and bales of cloth unsold;
and we must occasionally take the phrases of statutes
passed under the stress of some temporary
calamity as merely describing a distress too unaccustomed
to be borne in silence. For instance the
statute of 1488 which was passed during the depression
of trade that marked the first years of the
reign of Henry the Seventh proposed to restore
prosperity to the drapers’ craftsmen, for “they that
should obtain their needy sustentation and living by
means of the same drapery, for lack of such occupation
daily fall in great number to idleness and
poverty;”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> but the commercial treaties which distinguished
the next three or four years of Henry’s
reign were probably more effectual than any statute
of this kind, and they sufficiently prove that the
trade was not in a dying or decrepit state.</p>

<p>Occasionally too the murmurings of the people
only tell of troubles that follow every industrial
change. To an employer the new industry came to
search out the extent of his resources and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
activity. What with the haste to make wealth,
and the hurry of keeping pace with the demands
of foreign traders and of big markets, he was hard
pressed by the necessity of cheap and swift production,
and his attempts to improve his industrial
methods brought him into collision with workers
to whom ruder and more wasteful ways of doing
business were often more immediately profitable.
Labour disputes arose over questions of wages and
piece-work, of holidays, of the employment of women<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
and cheap workers. Occasionally the master carried
on an illicit industry&mdash;keeping workmen privately
engaged in his own house or on board a ship in
the port,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> so as to withdraw his servants from the
supervision of the town council, and his goods from
charges for the town dues. If he had accumulated
a little capital he perhaps moved out to the
valleys of Yorkshire or Gloucestershire in search
of water-power for his fulling-mills, or of finer
wool for his weavers; or forsook the manufacturing
town for some rural district where labour was
plentiful, and where he could escape the heavy
municipal dues which his business could ill afford
to pay. While the valley of the Stroud was
welcoming Flemish settlers and seeing mills spring
up along every stream, London and Canterbury
found their manufacturing trade slipping away
from them;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and the glory of Norwich departed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cloth-makers pushed along the moorland streams
of Yorkshire to Wakefield and Huddersfield and
Halifax, and set up fulling-mills among the few
peasant huts of remote hamlets.</p>

<p>Difficulties also arose when the manufacturer
began to contrive the first rude form of a factory
system, and so disturbed the occasional labour of
his neighbourhood; after the manner of the brewers
of Kent, who besides having to supply London and
the big trading ports of the coast were also beginning
to send out beer to Flanders, and who no longer
as of old bought their malt from the people, making
only some trifling hundred quarters or so in their
own houses, but began to make at home as much as
a thousand or even eighteen hundred quarters, to
the hurt of those farmers and youths who had once
gained a livelihood by preparing malt for sale.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Or
perhaps enterprising masters began to introduce
new machinery to keep pace with the increasing
demand for their wares. Such an innovation
was resisted as hotly as in our own century. The
shearers of cloth raised a cry against a new iron
instrument invented for raising the nap of cloth
so that it could be quickly burned off without
the old labour, while shearers were left idly loitering.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Among the cap-makers “some of the trade provided
a water-mill for fulling their caps” in 1376, by which
apprentices and freemen of the trade found themselves
deprived of work and “at the point of perishing.”
Their appeal to the town was of course on the ground
that caps so fulled were bad wear for the community,
and the mills were in consequence forbidden;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> but
a century of disobedience and evasions and wranglings
followed until the working fullers appealed to
Parliament itself, and in 1482 it was decreed that
hats, bonnets, and caps, which “were wont to be
faithfully ... thicked by men’s strength, that is
to say with hands and feet,” should never again be
fulled in fulling-mills invented “by subtle imagination
to the destruction of the labours and sustenance
of many men,” and to the “final undoing” of the
cap-makers.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Even the question of foreign immigration stirred
up contention between clothiers and weavers. Manufacturers
trading in marts where the fine work of
Flemish experts&mdash;the most skilful weavers in Europe&mdash;had
been displayed, required for the success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
their trade the services of the finely trained artizans
who took refuge in England from the ruin that
awaited them in Flanders, and in many a town
skilled immigrants found themselves welcome guests.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Under the protection of the classes to whom the
foreign artizan can never have been unwelcome&mdash;the
consumer, the merchant, and the master&mdash;he fared
well enough; for so long as he was subjected to the
local control of the guild or the municipality, forced
to dwell in the house of an Englishman, forbidden to
sell in retail, kept under a supervision so strict as
practically to shut him out from the market, the
employers of labour saw no reason for anxiety.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> On
the other hand the complacent view of the manufacturer
was not shared by the English artizan; and
in places where trade was shrinking or where there
was financial trouble the foreigner might chance to
be made into the luckless scape-goat of the community,
and have heaped on his head all the calamities
that burdened the guild or the municipality. For
example, in the middle of the fifteenth century when
the Bristol wool trade was half ruined by the loss
of Bordeaux which destroyed its great market and
brought about lasting changes in the French manufacturing
centres; and by the determination of the
Merchant Adventurers to establish in London and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
favour of London merchants a practical monopoly of
the cloth trade with the Northern Seas, a complaint
was made by the journeymen against the master-weavers
who had “brought in and put in occupation
of the craft strangers, persons of divers countries, not
born under the King’s obeisance but rebellious,” urged
the desperate working man in search of an unassailable
argument which should finally decide the
matter, “which been sold to them as it were heathen
people”; and the Mayor granted the desired order
that no foreign weaver should be brought into
Bristol<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>&mdash;a law which did not however restore
the cloth trade to their city.</p>

<p>In this case we seem really to hear the complaint of
the poor journeyman; and elsewhere, in appeals for
compassion and protection, in statutes of Parliament
and royal charters,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> or in ordinances of Town
Councils for his relief, we seem from time to time
to find ourselves on the brink of a labour problem
present to the modern as to the ancient world. But
generally the story of foreign immigration as it has
been handed down to us is in no sense the story of
the labour question. An association of masters
seeking to secure a strict monopoly for their
own advantage could not bring a more powerful
argument than the desperate situation of their
workmen&mdash;an argument which might be used by a
powerful corporation confident of official support, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
by a dying trade which had been utterly beaten in
the competitive struggle&mdash;and which taken alone
throws little light on the subject. When the dispute
with the foreigner emerges it generally seems to bear
the character of a quarrel among dealers rather than
a grudge of artizans. The working man had no
doubt his grievance, but it is not his voice which we
hear&mdash;it is the voice of his more noisy neighbour
the shopkeeper or the trader, who knowing that
he himself had little to expect from the sympathy
of the English consumer, passed briefly over the
subject of his own immediate interests, and used
with artistic skill the sufferings of the wage-earner
to kindle a general compassion and heighten the
effect of an appeal to an anxious government or
an alarmed public. For as we read the Town Ordinances
and Acts of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> these strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
“artificers” who were setting the world on fire put
on the guise of pedlars or small dealers who “bring
much foreign wares with them to sell,” and were
thus especially obnoxious to the native traders; such
foreign pests, it appears, were going “to men’s
doors” “taking up standings” and there “showing”
their wares to the undoing of the natives, and
hiring servants of their own people to retail their
goods about the country&mdash;an unpardonable offence
in the eyes of London merchants, who were moving
heaven and earth to become the only middlemen of
the foreign trade. With varying success the
native dealers clamoured for protective legislation,
praying that the strangers might be forbidden
to engage freely in trade, and forced as journeymen
to serve only an English master, or as masters to
employ only English servants. A usurper like Richard
the Third, anxious to conciliate the leading burghers
of the towns, was ready among other things to forbid
any alien whatever to become a handicraftsman, or
any foreigner to take an apprentice of his own people
save his own son or daughter;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> while on the other
hand, Henry the Seventh carried out his own views
of industrial policy by bringing weavers over to
develope the trade of Yorkshire and Devonshire.</p>

<p>But under whatever restrictions the foreigners
still came, and the same cry against them went
up loudly from time to time. Manufacturers and
middlemen who would have gladly welcomed immigrants
so long as they gave themselves out as men
working for hire, resented the invasion of strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
coming from over sea “with their wives, children,
and household, and will not take upon them any
laborious occupation as carting and ploughing but
use making of cloths and other handicrafts and easy
occupations;” and this apparently as masters, for
the complaint was that they employed only foreign
apprentices, so that English people were falling
into idleness and becoming thieves, beggars, and
vagabonds.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> “The land is so inhabited with a
great multitude of needy people, strangers of divers
nations ... that your liege people, Englishmen,
cannot imagine or tell whereto or to what occupation
that they shall use or put their children to learn
or occupy within your said cities or boroughs”&mdash;so
the Londoners complain in 1514: and add that if
this went on Englishmen would no longer be able to
pay their rents, maintain their households, and subdue
and vanquish their ancient enemies the French.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Hopeless, in fact, of combating the theory of his time
that trade legislation was meant in the first instance
to serve the interests of the buyer rather than the
dealer, and fearing lest an argument for monopoly
of sale might hardly withstand the criticism of a
hostile public, the trader was tempted to discover
some circuitous course, and catch at the cause of
the poor workman, the terror of the French, and the
patriotic vision of a nation of warrior weavers,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> as
infallible appeals to the sentiment of his time.</p>

<p>We find animosities and complaints of the same
kind directed against the struggling suburban manufacturers,
who competed with the townsfolk by dint
of braving every hardship, and accustoming their
hands to every form of labour. To the town manufacturer
they were an abomination; and he sought
to enlist the sympathy of the public by loud
complaints that it was only workmen who had
scarcely learned their trade who thus left their
masters to set up for themselves and make an
independent living. It is probable indeed that their
numbers were often recruited by small masters who
had fallen through poverty out of the regular ranks
of industry; as for example when an apprentice or
a stranger set up in business to try his luck,
and having been given perhaps three or four years in
which to pay by instalments the sum charged by the
guild for opening shop, made his escape out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the borough just before his last fine became due,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
being by that time possibly ready to start as a free
trader in an “upland” hovel, and to eke out
a scanty living by working at his hand loom or his
rope-making in the intervals of cultivating field or
garden. But such home industries, however they
originated, were inevitably disallowed by the municipal
organizers of labour. They diverted trade,
established a formidable competition of unregulated
labour, reduced tolls, and emptied the tax-gatherer’s
collecting box. Town councillors and shopkeepers
and journeymen with one accord declared war on those
who for their own “singular advantages and commodities,
nothing regarding the upholding of the said
towns, nor the common wealth of the handicrafts ...
nor the poor people which had living by the
same,” hired farms and became graziers and husbandmen,
and yet took to weaving, fulling, and shearing
cloths in their own houses;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> or who, like the grasping
people that withdrew from Bridport, took farms
“for their private lucre” and not only “used husbandry”
but made cables, ropes, ships’ tackling, and
halters in their idle hours.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Disputes of the kind which have been mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
however, were of trifling importance in the secular
controversy between the leaders of industry and the
general body of workers, as it presented itself in the
Middle Ages; and the great problem of all&mdash;that
which concerned no separate groups or industries,
but the whole mass of labour that was to be let out
for hire&mdash;was one inarticulate through its very magnitude.
While workers were being set free from
the land wherever arable farms were turned into
enclosed pastures for sheep farming, they were
called for by the manufacturer whose new business
of making cloth needed more hands than the old
business of selling wool. But the labour released
from the field was perhaps not always easily transferred
to the shop; and when the countryman who
with his fellows had toiled on the land</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“All for dread of their death such dints gave hunger,”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">and, save when harvest time gave a brief plenty, ate
in suffering his cake of oats with a few curds, his
“bread of beans and peases,” his onions and half-ripe
cherries, and little baked apples,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>&mdash;when he forsook
his “cote” and carried to the town nothing
but his hunger, his ignorance, his want of skill, he
did not necessarily mend his fortune by turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from the serf of the landlord into the wretched
dependent of the employer. Moreover, as though
the obstacles in the way of his helplessness were
not already sufficiently overwhelming, by the ingenious
device of man the difficulty was made yet
more acute. Artificial barriers to keep in check the
labour that clamoured at their gates were thrown up
with all the united strength of State and Town and
Guild. The State in order to protect the agricultural
interest strictly forbade the poor countryman to leave
husbandry for trade, or to apprentice his child to any
craft.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The towns for reasons of their own hastened
to intensify the effect of these laws by local regulations,
or by the strictness with which they carried out
old enactments.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Finally the guilds fenced themselves
about with rules to protect their monopoly by limiting
their numbers and shutting out intruders. As
the fifteenth century went on all these bodies alike
enforced their provisions with increasing severity,
and the danger that threatened the working-class
through the industrial revolution was hardened into
a present calamity.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive that regulations of this
kind were self-denying ordinances on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
employers to limit the supply of labour; they rather
come to us as echoes of the first great controversy
concerning the position and privileges of the hired
worker. The “protection” of industry from all
competition was the first and the last creed of the
crafts (as distinguished from the general public)&mdash;a
protection by which every conceivable danger that
might threaten the interests of the monopolists was
struck down, whether it was the competition of
other allied trades, or that introduced by machinery
and new methods of organizing labour, or rivalry
between members in the same craft, or the intrusion
of dealers from the provinces, or the immigration of
alien manufacturers from abroad. As to the main
principle there was no dispute; and there were
some of its less important developements where the
interests of the masters and the journeymen coincided.
But to employers and dealers the monopoly
of trade chiefly meant their own monopoly of production
and sale; while the wage-earner’s dominant
anxiety was to keep surplus labour out of the craft,
lest the regular workman might be deprived of his
comfortable certainty of subsistence. Labour however
was too sorely needed in the enormously
increasing trade of the country for masters to deny
themselves its services; nor did any of their ordinances
necessarily tend in the least to produce a
result so disastrous to themselves. In their eyes the
important matter was that workers should be kept
docile and obedient, retained in country districts
where they were most advantageous to the contractor,
and prevented from making claims on the control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
or the profits of industry which must have hampered
the great business of the moment&mdash;the expansion
of English trade; and the ability of the craft-leaders
was shown in the masterly tactics which they
adopted, the success which they achieved, and the
political sagacity by which they accomplished their
purpose without open strife or public agitation.</p>

<p>For it seems probable that the labour question had
its origin with the very beginning of manufacturing
industries, and that long before the fifteenth century a
large class of hired workers already existed. We know
that in the fourteenth century the wage-earners in
the crafts already constituted a force which the State
and the municipality had come to fear, and that not
only in London but in other towns journeymen had
learned discontent, and had begun to combine for
self-protection.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> We know also that before 1340
one manufacturing town at least (and no doubt the
records will ultimately tell of more) owned its miserable
race of labourers who worked by the day at a
bare subsistence wage of a penny, an outcast people
whose abject poverty was their only protection; men
possessing absolutely nothing by which they could be
attached for crimes or offences, and who could laugh
at any attempt of the court to summon or to fine
them; while their employers, not being held legally
responsible save under some special ordinance for such
day labourers as these, took no care for the debt or
crime of a class without privilege or standing in
the eye of the law.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> And obscure as the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
still is, we seem at a very early time to detect behind
the guild system a growing class of “uncovenanted”
labour, which the policy of the employers constantly
tended to foster, their aim being on the one hand to
limit the number of privileged serving-men, and on
the other to increase the supply of unprotected
workers.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that while the demand for
manufactures was increasing beyond all experience,
the number of men who sought through apprenticeship
to enter the trade was most strictly limited by
law;<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and when a man had finished his apprenticeship
cunning devices were found for casting him
back among the rank and file of hired labourers;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
so that the skilled workman who had passed through
his time of service but had not been admitted to
the freedom of his trade<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>&mdash;whether because he failed
to secure the recommendation of the heads of the
guild, or because he was unable to pay the double
fees demanded for the franchise of the city and the
franchise of the craft<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>&mdash;was condemned henceforth
to remain a mere journeyman without apparently
much hope of promotion. For the enrolled journeyman
there was some protection, though of a very
limited kind, in the guild; but a lower and more
helpless class of serving-men was recruited from the
apprentices who had not worked out their full time&mdash;poor
children whose service had begun at seven
or twelve, and who while yet mere lads were induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to cut short the seven or ten years fixed in their
trade for apprenticeship, and entering hastily on
work for a daily wage found themselves from that
time forward counted as unskilled labourers;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> apparently
deprived of the protection of the law in the
matter of wages, without any standing in the guild,
and lying in the power of the craft-masters for their
hire, they were for the rest of their lives admitted
to work on sufferance as bringing cheap labour into
the market. Finally even the statutes which forbade
poor country people to apprentice their children
in the towns,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> far from proving any intention of
withdrawing the villagers from the service of the
manufacturer, may have been the result of an alliance
between landowner and employer to serve their
several ends, and have been designed by the town
magnate merely to prevent the dependent country
workers from flocking into the boroughs in search of
apprenticeship and subsequent freedom of the trade.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
For it seems probable that the town dealers had very
early been accustomed to contract with the country
folk for the lower and rougher kinds of work. In
Norwich, for example, all the tanners’ business was at
first done in the country, and the skins sent into Norwich
to be worked and finished by the parmenters;
and it was perhaps but a generation before the passing
of the Act of Henry the Fourth that the tanners came
into Norwich and settled down by its river side. And
in like manner all cloth brought to the Norwich market
was country-made, and originally no wool was sold in
the Norwich streets and no cloth manufactured in its
workshops.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The same system of contracting for
work in surrounding villages<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> was known far beyond
Norwich, but its local history varied greatly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
local circumstances. In that city, where trade was
manifestly too vigorous to be shut up into a few
square miles, and where the surrounding population
had turned into a people of journeymen and artizans,
the municipality seems to have inaugurated the
policy of governing an industry it had no desire to
suppress, by seizing the organization of the country
districts into the same hands as that of the town,
and bringing the workers under the same municipal
control<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>&mdash;a policy, it would seem, of merchants and
employers mainly occupied with the expansion of commerce,
and blind to the danger which their experiment
implied of the breaking up of municipal life. But in
other towns we seem to detect a vain attempt of the
working population to clutch at a trade which had
grown into a free maturity, and force it back into
the old municipal nursery under the tutors and
governors of its infancy; as in Worcester, where the
ordinances contain many proofs of having been drawn
up under strong popular influences, and where the
masters were forbidden to give out wool to weavers
so long as there were people enough in the city to do
the work, “in the hindering of the poor commonalty
of the same.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> It is evident that the manufacturer
might, from his own point of view, feel the strongest
objection to flooding the towns with an unmanageable
number of workers attached to the guild who
could, by virtue of their numbers and their covenanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
position, call on the municipal government to
interfere for their special benefit in the management
of the trade.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>If we consider therefore the case of the working
population in town or country&mdash;whether we remember
the poor folk of the hamlets, known to Langland,
that “have no chattel but their crafts and few pence
taketh;”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> or consider in the towns the lowest class
of casual labourers working at a wage of a penny
a day, or the little more fortunate groups of unskilled
serving-men, or the depressed company of the
skilled journeymen; whether we trace in villages or
boroughs the astonishing multitude of religious fraternities
which sometimes at least concealed an illicit
attempt at self-protection by the wage-earners; or
examine the rigour with which towns and guilds repressed
every attempt of the working men to combine
in any association for their common benefit&mdash;we
find ourselves again and again confronted with
the problem of labour. In the thick darkness which
still envelopes the subject dogmatism itself is swallowed
up. But as we look into the obscurity, the
borderland of the covenanted trades and the dim regions
that lie beyond their recognized limits become
crowded with the masses of the common workers&mdash;dreary
groups of labourers seething with inarticulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
discontent, themselves suffering the terrors and
bondage of a harsh law, and from time to time, as
they emerge into a brief light of riot and disorder,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
kindling the alarms of the settled and protected
classes above them. Associations of the richer merchants
inspired by a common interest drew together
for mutual support; and friendly Town Councils
whose policy was to keep down the number of voters&mdash;especially
of poor craftsmen who might be troublesome&mdash;and
all whose members were indeed themselves
employers and craft masters, made alliance
with the guilds, and passed laws which, by shutting
out apprentices from the freedom of the craft, debarred
them from the franchise of the town. It
was in vain that from time to time as the evil increased
the central government sought to interfere
with craft-masters and wardens who “for their own
singular profit” made ingenious bye-laws or ordinances
for the exclusion of new comers;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> local
alliances were too strong for it, and local wits too
cunning, and one of the main results of the triumphant
guild system was to develope throughout
the country a formless and incoherent multitude of
hired labourers, who could by no possibility rise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
positions of independence, and had no means of association
in self-defence. As the weaker members
of the crowd from time to time sank back into utter
penury, the outcasts of the industrial system slowly
gathered into a new brotherhood of the destitute;
and even in the fifteenth century, long before they
had been reinforced by the waifs and strays of town
and country that flocked into their sad fellowship
on the dissolution of the monasteries, the advanced
guard of the army of paupers appears in the streets
of the boroughs to trouble the counsels of municipal
rulers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CRAFTS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> early history of the craft guilds, like that of
the municipalities, is the story of communities in
the first strength of youth, growing by the force of
their own vitality into forms which can be reduced
to no mechanical regularity or order, and ever plastic
to take on new shapes according to the shifting
exigencies of an age when industry, commerce, local
government, were all in a state of revolution. In
the pride of their first creation, in the humiliation
of their later apparent subjection, in the victorious
results at last of their long discipline, the guilds
reflected successive movements in the great change
that transformed English society; and it would be
hard to find a single formula in which to express a
life so free and various. Like the boroughs their
systems of government ranged from constitutions
which, if not democratic, were at least republican,
to constitutions which placed in command an oligarchy,
whether limited or despotic; so that we can
scarcely say that the towns borrowed their methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from the guilds, or the guilds from the towns, at a
time when both alike were perhaps tentatively
feeling their way towards the only solutions of the
problem of government which the time and occasion
admitted. They had the same period of intense
activity, from the awakening of the new life of
England under the Norman kings, till under
Henry the Seventh its industrial and commercial
position was definitely established. The very difficulties
by which they were hemmed in were the
true conditions of any lively growth; and it was
not till the sixteenth century, when the militant life
of the crafts came to an end, that a fatal monotony
settled down on their associations&mdash;a dreary
uniformity<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> both of constitution and of policy, which
makes their period of triumphant prosperity and
imminent decay a record at once tedious and disheartening.</p>

<p>In dealing with the history of commerce the craft
guilds necessarily take a foremost place in their
character of trading or manufacturing associations;
but we are here mainly concerned with what we may
call their political relations to the borough, and their
influence on the growth of municipal life. The constitution
of the craft becomes therefore important,
not from its economic results, but as indicating the
character and complexion of the guild, the policy
which it might be expected to pursue if it attained
to authority, and the extent to which it could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
supposed to favour popular or democratic theories of
government. How far the crafts were actually able
to make their influence felt depends on a second
question as to the connexion that existed&mdash;of what
kind and closeness it may have been&mdash;between the
guilds and the governing body of the borough.</p>

<p>We must remember that the various craft guilds
represented all ranks and classes in the industrial
world&mdash;the capitalist, the middleman, and the
working man. There were aristocratic fraternities
of the Merchant Adventurers, and of dealers living
by the profits of commerce alone, who were grouped
in the great mercantile companies such as the
vintners and spicers and grocers and mercers. In
a lower scale were the middlemen and traders
who produced little or nothing themselves, but
made their living mainly by selling the produce
of the labour of others&mdash;such as the saddlers,
the drapers, the leather-sellers, the hatters&mdash;and
whose unions were in fact formidable combinations
of employers. Below these again came guilds of
artizans employed in preparing work for the dealers,
to be by them sold to the general public, as the
smiths who worked for the tailors or linen-armourers,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
the weavers who supplied the clothiers; the joiners,
painters, ironsmiths, and coppersmiths who made the
saddles and harness for the saddlers; the tawyers
who prepared skins for the leather-sellers; the
cap-makers who fulled the caps which the hatters
sold.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Finally there remained the crafts which both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
manufactured and sold their own wares, like the
bakers, tailors, or shoemakers, and who dealt directly
with the consumer without the intervention of any
other guild. It is evident that these various associations
had all their own business to do,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and that
their policy differed as widely as did the interests of
the several classes. We do not find a guild of
merchants or dealers trying to raise wages or shorten
hours; or a guild of artizans seeking to depress
labour and assert the supremacy of the middleman;
or a mixed guild of masters and men intent upon
lowering prices for the public. But we may still
ask whether behind all obvious divergences of interest
and of power, there was any ruling instinct common
to all these brotherhoods of trade.</p>

<p>The original motives which drew men together
into craft guilds were no doubt everywhere the same&mdash;the
desire to obtain the monopoly of their trade
and complete control over it;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and also to find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
security which in those days organized associations
alone could give to the poor and helpless against
tyrannical and corrupt administration of the law,
just as in the country men enrolled themselves
under the livery of a lord or knight who was
their adequate protector against the iniquities of the
courts<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and by whose arbitration their quarrels were
adjusted.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> For these purposes associations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
formed of the entire trades of various districts. All
the members of the craft, great and small, were
enrolled in the fraternity; and thus every guild, to
whatever order in the hierarchy of industry it
belonged, contained within itself the various ranks
of workers who belonged to that particular occupation.
It is in this organization of the whole craft
into a compact body arrayed in self-defence against
the world outside, and in the means that were used
to maintain it, that we trace the peculiar characteristics
of the mediæval guild as opposed to those of
modern associations. From the very outset its
society was based on compulsion. Dealer or artizan
had no choice as to whether he would join the
association of his trade or no, that question being
settled by the charter which gave the craft power to
compel every workman to enter into its circle. A
constitution such as this left a profound mark on the
conduct and ultimate policy of every guild, for where
there was no real freedom of association there proved
at last to be no real freedom of government.
Societies such as the modern trade union, created and
maintained by the good will of men naturally bound
to one another by common occupation and interests,
and who expect from their association a common
benefit, may long persist as voluntary institutions
with a democratic government. But the ancient
guild&mdash;a fraternity of the whole trade with all its
ranks and classes, employers and wage-earners alike,
compulsorily bound together into one fellowship as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
against the world without, and whose common interest
in association tended to become more and more
visionary&mdash;was inevitably driven to preserve by force
an artificial and ill-compacted union; and instead of
a free self-governing community, there grew up a
society ruled by its leading members in a more
or less despotic fashion, according to the character of
the trade itself and to the support given to its
governors by the authorities at Westminster or in
the municipality.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>(1) For it is plain that no intimate union can ever
have existed between the three orders that practically
made up the guild.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> At the head of the society stood
the master and the aldermen or wardens, drawn from
among the wealthiest men of the trade; and grouped
immediately round them were all those who, after
having passed through these offices, retained for life
a position of dignity among the members, and from
whom the court of assistants or governing council
was wholly or partly formed.</p>

<p>(2) Then came the commonalty, the craft-holders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
or shopkeepers or “masters” of the trade&mdash;a term
which by no means necessarily implies <i>employers</i> of
labour, but rather artificers admitted into the
“mestier”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> or mistery&mdash;who were alone responsible
before the law for offences<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> committed in their shops
or work-rooms, and were therefore alone authorized
by the guild to take work from a customer.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>(3) Last came the hired workers&mdash;that is the
trained journeymen or serving-men; for the unskilled
labourers working for a daily hire and
apprentices can scarcely be reckoned as in any
sense members of the guild.</p>

<p>In a society thus constituted the notion of self-government
never for a moment implied the modern
notion of democracy, or even the idea that authority
should be exercised only by the will of the majority.
In some fraternities indeed the whole community
of craft-masters took part directly in the yearly
election of officers, though probably this was the
extreme bound and limit of their influence;<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in general there was the same tendency in the guilds
as in the boroughs to choose their governors by some
indirect and complicated system through which the
commonalty was kept well in restraint. Either the
alderman himself nominated candidates for the various
offices, from among whom the select council or fellowship
made their choice, or he appointed a few picked
men, five or seven or eight as the case might be, to
choose the rulers for the next year.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> In the same
way the two or four “sufficient and discreet men”
who were to assist the alderman, “the helpmen and
overseers,” or the council of eight or twelve or twenty-four,
were chosen either by a similar committee, or by
the direct choice of the alderman himself “with the
aid of his fraternity.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Nor is there any evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that this method of government by the select few
was a growth of later corruption; it is more probable
that in societies which could only be founded at the
wish of the more prosperous men in the trade, since
they alone could undertake to raise the money for its
charter or guarantee the payment of its yearly rent,
these men were accustomed, in return for their
money or as a security for it, to hold the management
of the community in their own hands; and this
seems confirmed by traces of the system which we
find in very early times, as well as by what we know
of the origins of later fraternities.</p>

<p>If the power of the masters was thus limited, the
mere journeymen were practically of no account
at all in such great matters as election and legislation.
Perhaps in some trades they occasionally
exercized a slight influence, as in the case of the
London bowyers, whose ordinances were agreed to
“as well by serving-men as by masters.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> But in
general it is doubtful whether the voice of the hired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
worker was ever heard or his will consulted, however
much his obedience to the ordinances was required
and enforced. It was supposed that his interests were
sufficiently protected by the town authorities, to
whom an alien who was cheated by his master, a
journeyman who found his wages paid on the truck
system, or a weaver who saw his labour supplanted by
that of a woman or a foreigner, could make his complaint;
and who were bound to see that no freeman
of the borough took more apprentices into his household
than he could promise to support comfortably;
that the apprentice was not chastised beyond measure,
nor turned out penniless at the end of his service;<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
and that no fraudulent action of his master should rob
him of the benefit of the exact tale of the years of
service he had fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In all that concerned the hired worker, indeed,
law had become so rigid and so detailed by the time
that Parliament, the Town Council, and the Craft
wardens, had taken their turn at legislation, that it
might be plausibly assumed that nothing remained
for the discussion of the working man. By a series
of statutes Parliament endeavoured to keep the hire
of the workers and the length of the working day
fixed in spite of the increase of trade;<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and mayors
and bailiffs in all boroughs<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> were ordered to compel
labour to keep its allotted times, and to proclaim
the wages of craftsmen twice a year, “and that a
pair of stocks be in every town to justify the same
servants and labourers.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Whatever was left undefined
by Parliament was put under rule by the
subordinate authorities. Town Councils made provision
for the punishment of “rebel and contrarious”
men in the mayor’s court, examined and
corrected the customs of the crafts, forbade workmen
to make their bargains anywhere save openly at
the market cross, and fined them if they stood there
beyond one day in the week,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> probably on the supposition
that they were holding out for a higher
wage or shorter hours. The guild-masters regulated
the prices to be paid for piece-work,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> issued orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
allowing work to be done by night, and made rules as
to apprenticeship and service.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> For greater security
moreover the masters were accustomed to enter
into covenants for mutual protection against their
servants&mdash;“And if any serving-man shall conduct
himself in any other manner than properly towards
his master, and act rebelliously towards him,” said
the Whittawyers, “no one of the trade shall set him
to work until he shall have made amends before the
mayor and aldermen.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> On the other hand journeymen
were invariably bound by oath not to make any
sort of confederation among themselves,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>&mdash;a precaution
which State and town and guild were equally
vigilant in enforcing. Under such a system as this,
if at any time the workers proposed to disturb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the statute wage or the statute day, they had to
contend not only against the upper class of their own
craft, the masters and wardens and shopkeepers, but
against the governing body of the town, and the
opposition of the whole community.</p>

<p>Neither oaths nor laws nor public opinion however
could permanently prevent men from combining to
better their position, and from time to time we can
follow the fortunes of a struggle which, when the
town records are published, will probably be shown to
have been very general. In London alone we have
during a single century records of strikes among the
workmen of four trades&mdash;the shearmen, the saddlers,
the shoemakers, and the tailors.</p>

<p>The journeymen of the cloth shearers took a lesson
in combination from the employers. “If there was
any dispute between a master in the said trade and
his man,” ran the complaint of the masters about
1350, “such man has been wont to go to all the men
within the city of the same trade, and then by covin
and conspiracy between them made, they would order
that no one among them should work or serve his own
master, until the said master and his servant or man
had come to an agreement; by reason whereof
the masters in the said trade have been in great
trouble and the people left unserved.” These men
were also making a covert attempt to raise their
payment by refusing to work at day wages, and
insisting on piece-work through which they could
gain more money; while the masters, so long as they
were forced by law to sell at a fixed price, had a
valid reason for protesting before the mayor that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
there must be some relation between lowering the
price of their wares and raising the wages of their
workmen, or they themselves would be set between
the upper and nether mill-stone; and for making a
petition that the men might be chastised and commanded
to work according to the ancient usage “as
matter of charity and for the profit of the people.”
The city magistrates granted ordinances which forbade
any attempt to settle trade disputes by strikes,
and ordered all complaints to be brought before the
warden of the craft (himself of course a master), and
failing him before the mayor. Though the court did
not forbid piece-work, it fixed its price at the low rate
that prevailed before the Plague.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> On the whole the
victory therefore lay with the masters.</p>

<p>The shoemakers’ servants were early in the field.
They made their first rebellion before 1306, the main
results of which seem to have been a decree added
to their old ordinances that the journeymen of the
trade should make no provisions to the prejudice
of the public;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and perhaps the imposition of an
oath that they would not make among themselves
any union or confederation.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> For eighty years
they waited before making a new attempt. At
last in 1387 a “great congregation” of them
met at the Black Friars “and there did conspire
and confederate to hold together ... and because
that Richard Bonet of the trade aforesaid would
not agree with them made assault upon him so
that he hardly escaped with his life ... to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
alarm of the neighbours.” The meeting was illegal,
not only because of their oath, but because of a law
passed four years before to forbid any confederation
among workers; so to make their position more regular
the poor shoemakers hit upon the plan of calling in the
help of a friendly friar preacher, “Brother William
Bartone by name, who had made an agreement with
their companions that he would make suit in the
Court of Rome for confirmation of that fraternity by
the Pope; so that on pain of excommunication and
of still more grievous sentence (!) afterwards to be
fulminated, no man should dare to interfere with the
well-being of the fraternity. For doing the which he
had received a certain sum of money which had been
collected among their said companions.” This form
of Papal interference, however, was not to the mind
of Londoners&mdash;“a deed,” they said, “which notoriously
redounds to the weakening of the liberties of
the said city and of the powers of the officers of the
same.” The mayor accordingly threw the leaders into
prison,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and the attempt of the luckless journeymen
came to an end.</p>

<p>The serving-men of the saddlers tried another plan,
and formed in 1383 a religious fraternity whose ostensible
duties were perfectly harmless. Its members
were wont once a year to array themselves in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
like suit and go out beyond the city bounds to
Stratford (in other words, out of reach for the moment
of the city authorities) where they held a meeting,
and returned to hear mass in honour of the Virgin in
the church next to the Saddlers’ Hall; also from
time to time their beadle would summon journeymen
to attend at vigils of the dead and pray for the souls
of their old comrades. According to the masters,
however, this was but “a certain feigned colour of
sanctity” under which the men merely wasted their
masters’ time and conspired to “raise wages greatly
in excess”&mdash;in fact in the space of thirteen years,
from 1373 to 1396, they had increased their hire to
twice or three times the old customary rate. The
mayor and aldermen agreed with the masters as to
the dangerous character of these proceedings, forbade
any such meetings or any fraternities for the future,
and ordered that the serving-men should be under the
masters, and that the “masters must properly treat
and govern” them as in all other trades.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The journeymen tailors took a bolder line, for they
not only held illegal meetings both within and without
the city bounds, at which they assembled wearing a
common livery, but also hired houses in the city
where they lived in companies, and defied both their
own masters and the officers of the city. Whereupon
the masters and wardens of the trade notified to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
mayor and aldermen “that they were exceedingly
sorrowful at there being such offenders and such
misdeeds”; and the mayor and aldermen “after
holding careful council and conference thereon”
decided that it was manifestly to the public peril
to allow journeymen and serving-men&mdash;a race at
once youthful and unstable&mdash;to have a common
livery at their assemblies, or common dwelling-houses
by themselves. The settlement was broken
up, and livery and meetings forbidden. Then the
tailors also put on the colour of sanctity, and a couple
of years later (in 1417) we find them petitioning
to be allowed to meet for prayers and offerings for
the souls of deceased tailors.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>That similar attempts, with the same impotent
conclusions, took place in other manufacturing towns
is certain; though we have not yet the means of
measuring the extent of the movement. The uniform
failure of every effort at revolt, even the acquiescence
of the workmen when revolt was impossible, declare
the helplessness of the mediæval labourer, entangled
as he was in a vast net-work of commercial theories,
administrative maxims, and arguments of vested
interests public and private. For in a society where
law ruled all industry, the whole community was on
the alert to resist any defiance of ordinances avowedly
made for their own protection.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The right to strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
was denied by law and vehemently resisted by
public opinion as contrary to the common good; and
disputes were settled, not as now by an agreement
voluntarily made within the trade, but by the formal
decision of the municipality, against which there was
no appeal.</p>

<p>At the same time it is evident that in their dealings
with journeymen and hired servants, if in no other
respect, the municipalities did no more than carry
out exactly the intentions of the guilds themselves.
From the moment that they come into view the crafts&mdash;that
is, all the more important ones, for from the
nature of the case we know very little about the
poorer sort of associations or the humbler trades
concealed under the form of religious societies&mdash;are
distinguished by the same creed and policy. Their
essential character was laid down in the oligarchic
schemes of administration to which they inclined;
and, as we have seen, the purity of the guild government
was further maintained by the pains which was
taken to prevent the journeymen from pressing
on into the upper ranks and weakening the established
system by multiplying the number of small
masters; and to select with adequate care the people
admitted to be subjects with constitutional rights&mdash;a
people chosen as far as possible from an upper
class and even from the hereditary stock of the guild.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
By an original stringent constitution therefore, and
by their own later discipline, the governing oligarchy
was protected as by a double course of
entrenchments; and a third line of defence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
formed by keeping guard over every entrance
through which the common workman might make
his way into the superior class of artizans who,
in however inferior a degree, might still be recognized
as more or less officially attached to the craft.
In its very nature, therefore, the guild organization
was adverse to the claims of the men who
worked for hire, and under its government the
journeyman was practically condemned without a
hearing. What with the influence exercised by the
masters in the Town Council and government, and
what with the credulous fears of the public of consumers
when they were told what “contrarious”
workmen might do in raising prices and limiting
supply, and “the many losses which might happen
in future times” through combinations of hired
labour, the victory of the employers was never for a
moment doubtful,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and unions of journeymen such
as those which sprang up in the fourteenth and first
half of the fifteenth centuries, broken and disabled
almost at the outset, seem, so far as we can see, to
have been again and again crushed out of existence
by the overwhelming forces of guild and town and
state brought to bear on them, and to have found
no permanent life till the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There was no doubt a sense in which the strong
rule of a governing oligarchy fully justified itself
throughout the course of the struggle for autonomy
between the rising crafts and the rising municipalities.
Shaking itself free from discussions and
divisions within its own body by asserting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
triumph of the stronger party, the guild was able
to maintain in practice the consistent theory of its
constitution&mdash;the undisputed supremacy of the masters
in the regulation of the trade policy; and
through centuries of varying and doubtful fortunes
the crafts still contrived to present to the world
outside an unbroken front and a certain air of independence;
holding together in companies under
leaders of their own choosing, and, save in rare
instances, scorning to stoop to the custom common
in France or Germany of having their chief officer
appointed by some external authority.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> But this
bold militant attitude was only maintained through
a rigid discipline, and by a ruthless suppression of
every attempt to break the ranks. A body to all
appearance uniform, but in fact split up into two
or three hostile groups, the craft only preserved
its air of harmony by abandoning all pretence at
democratic government, and avowedly subduing the
weaker classes to the stronger. The policy which
had been its safety in the time of conflict remained
its settled creed in the time of power. It is clear,
therefore, that if ever the members of the guild forced
their way into the council chamber of the town,
their appearance can scarcely be taken as marking a
popular or democratic movement. That it enlarged
the governing class by bringing in a new group of
men to take part in the active political life of the
country is evident; but on the other hand these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
men do not seem to have contributed a single idea to
political experience, or carried political experiment a
single step further. Saturated with the customary
views of administration which were the fashion in the
upper class of town society, and by which their own
interests had been so well served, the craft-masters
sent their representatives to the council only to give
new strength to the coercive policy of the governing
oligarchy. The character of the trade fraternity
was fully shown when, victorious over the foes of its
own household, strong in its complete organization,
the craft guild rose out of its long subjection to
public control, and seizing into its own hands municipal
authority, destroyed its terrors for the trader.
When this last step was taken the crafts stood
forth in full realization of their ideal&mdash;close corporations
fully equipped against the whole body of
consumers, and masters of the labour of the country.
What has been called the decline of the guild system
may more truly be called its triumph&mdash;the revelation
of its constant aim and true significance.</p>

<p class="pn1">The hire of women, children, and artificers remained the same.
(11 Henry VII. cap. 22.)</p>

<p class="p1">By 12 Henry VII. cap. 3, all statutes fixing the wages of artificers
and labourers were made void for masons and all concerned
in building, and servants in husbandry. Rogers (Work
and Wages, ii. 327) fixes the wages of the ordinary artizan in the
fifteenth century at 6<i>d.</i> a day and agricultural wages at 4<i>d.</i>,
carpenters a little under 6<i>d.</i>, plumbers 6-1/2<i>d.</i>, masons 6<i>d.</i> The
board of a skilled artizan might cost in 1438 about 2<i>s.</i>, of a common
labourer about 1<i>s.</i>, very commonly from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>, most
generally 8<i>d.</i> (Agriculture and Prices, iv. 505, 751-2.) In 1395 a
Nottingham “layer” was charged for working two days as stone-cutter
for 12<i>d.</i> against the law, and the jury stated that “all the
carpenters, all the plasterers, all the stone-cutters, all the labourers,
take too much for their craft by the day, against the statute of
our lord the King.” (Nott. Rec. i. 275.) For a list of wages paid
in 1464 see ibid. ii. 370-373; in 1511 iii. 328-337. In 1495 a
man was employed to dig stones at 3<i>d.</i> a day without food.</p>

<p>That there was difficulty in enforcing the legal wage and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
there was often a difference between the prices actually paid and
those which the law books spoke of as still valid is evident from
the ingenious methods in use of evading the law. Sometimes the
workman was paid his board wages and given his food besides;
or false entries were made in the account books; or a yearly fee
was given in addition to wages; or he was paid a sum of so much
a mile for coming to and going from his work; or his wages
were calculated at 6<i>d.</i> or 5<i>d.</i> according to ability for 365 days in
the year, against the statute which forbade the workman to
receive hire for holidays or for the eves of feasts. (Rogers’
Agric. and Prices, i. 255; Work and Wages, ii. 328-330; Stat. 4
Henry IV. cap. 14.)</p>

<p>The legal hours of work for country labourers from March
to September were from 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> till between 7 and 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, with
half an hour for breakfast, an hour and a half for dinner;
from September to March, from the springing of the day
till the night of the same day. They were not to sleep in
day-time save after dinner from May to August. (Stat.
11 Henry VII. cap. 22.) The Saturday half-holiday from noon
seems to have been universal. In shops trading on Sundays,
holidays and vigils was very generally forbidden in the middle of
the fifteenth century, save in harvest time, and unless “great high
need may excuse.” (Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, ii. 190; Hist.
MSS. Com. xi. 3, 169.) Rogers (Work and Wages, i. 180-2)
calculates that an artizan working three hundred days a year
could earn from £3 15<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> to £4 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and in London might
get from £6 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> to £6 17<i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> a year. Walter of Henley
(ed. by Miss Lamond, p. 9) gives forty-four weeks, leaving eight
weeks “for holidays and other hindrances.” But in his translation
of Walter’s Husbandry, Bishop Grosseteste adds a phrase
(ibid. 45) which throws a new light on the matter. “In these
forty-four weeks be 264 days besides Sundays”&mdash;an explanation
which certainly expands the amount of leisure allowed to country
labourers, whether it applied to town artizans or no.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CRAFTS AND THE TOWN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the mediæval Craft Association to the
modern Trade Union the distance, as we have seen,
is great. In the guild or “mistery” of the older
world, instead of associations of working men we
have to deal mainly with associations of producers
or middlemen, whose battle is not the organized
attack of wage-earners on the profits of their masters,
but an attempt of dealers and manufacturers to stand
out for their interests against the whole body of
consumers or against the aggressions of competing
trades; while far from being a voluntary association,
or a self-governed institution of spontaneous
growth, its individual members were if necessary
enrolled by compulsion, and governed with little
regard to their own consent. But the relations
between the trades and the municipalities show a
yet more striking contrast. According to a modern
English theory the common good is best served when
we allow every artizan and trader perfect liberty to
develope his own industry in his own way.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the mediæval world was fully convinced that since
all trade and manufacture was carried on for the
benefit of the public, all trade and manufacture
should be subject to public control; and no one
then questioned that it was the duty and the right
of the State or the municipality to fix hours of
labour, rates of wages, prices of goods, times and
places of sale, the quality of the wares to be sold, and
so on. In the interest, not of the trader or manufacturer,
but of the whole community, the central
government made general laws for regulating industry,
and the towns carried out these laws by their
officers and filled up the blanks of legislation after
their own will; while in the exercise of the enormous
power which law and public opinion gave to
the authorities, the power of the people was supposed
to be used with impartial justice alike against
the dealer or the employer and the artizan or serving
man, whenever individual claims clashed with what
seemed to be the public advantage. Hence to the
governing body of the borough the trade association
was a mere matter of public convenience; and
was so little regarded as depending on the free will
of the craft itself that it was frequently founded by
order of the town, and was invariably compelled to
make submission to superior force and receive orders
from its master the municipality. Unable to secure
the passing of any new rule save by convincing the
authorities on some pretext or other that it was
devised in the interest of the whole commonwealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the craft came at last to be considered as a society
which existed mainly for the advantage of “the
common people of the realm,” and indeed, bowing
to a hard necessity, itself contracted the habit of
solemnly disavowing any special regard for “its own
singular profit,” and apologetically described itself as
the humble servant of the municipality and the
obedient minister of the public, in phrazes which the
modern trade union would scarcely accept as an
adequate description of its uses.</p>

<p>This service of the public, however, was in no sense
a voluntary tribute of the guilds, nor did it enter
in the slightest degree into their original scheme;
and if through long and severe compulsion the crafts
learned to wear with decorum their odd cloke of
apparent devotion to the common weal, behind this
ostensible policy and feigned colour of self-abnegation
they had still their own purposes to serve,
which were by no means the purposes of the rest
of the community. Occasions of discord were probably
far more frequent than provocations to unity
and concord in the society of a mediæval town, with
its hierarchy of struggling workers&mdash;the rising
dealers, the small masters who employed two or
three servants, the artizans who let down the ledge
from their window to display the goods which they
had themselves made, journeymen working for a statute
wage, and unskilled labourers for whatever they could
get&mdash;men for the most part living meagrely by incessant
toil, and to whom the public, thrifty and inclined
to bargains, was “the enemy”; and with its
population of consumers, poor and ignorant, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the means of travelling, forced to buy what they wanted
on the spot and thus deprived of such protection as
may be given by a larger competition, able to afford
little beyond the mere necessaries of life so that
every fraud brought to them real suffering, and to
whom the trader represented the ancient adversary
lying in wait among the gins which he had privily
set for the innocent. The thin veil of civility
thrown over the situation by the polite phrazes of
contemporary convention which have come down to
us in ordinance and compact deceived nobody concerned;
and between the “poor commons” and
the whole army of crafts reconciliation never went
farther than an armed truce. To the consumer the
dealers seemed all alike steeped in iniquity. Shopkeepers
measured out their wares “by horn or by
aim of hand,” or in chance cups and dishes; and
sold in dark corners where a man could not see
what scamped work and deceitful goods were being
handed over to him. Clothiers gave out bad yarn
in scanty measure, and stretched out the list of
their cloth with cunning presses “in deceit of the
poor commons.” Hatters because they knew that
everyone must needs wear hats charged exorbitantly
for their wares, and shoemakers were no better,
so that statute after statute vainly sought to
mend them. Chandlers asked scandalous prices for
wax candles, images, and figures, “by which means
divers of the people be defrauded of their good
intent and devotion.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> “All the bakers, butchers,
fishers, taverners, poulterers, chandlers, tanners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
shoemakers, cooks, hostelers, weavers, and fullers,”
according to the comprehensive statement of the
Nottingham Mickletorn jury in 1395, were asking
too high prices and selling bad goods; and they go
on the next year to repeat the same complaints.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
Above all the anger of the common folk burned
hot against the traders they knew best, the powerful
licensed victuallers who heaped up to themselves
riches with the food that should have fed the starving
workers: “for took they on truly, they timbered not
so high.” The “sundry sorrows in cities,” fevers
and murrains and floods, or fires which burned down
half the town and seemed ever to begin by the
falling of a candle at a brewer’s or some “cursed
place,” were the vivid testimony of the anathema
of the poor and the righteous vengeance of heaven
falling on the sinful traders;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and the common
rumour of the market is still heard behind the poet’s
parable of the day when Guile was at the point of
death, and when it was only the shopkeepers who
recovered him to life:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But merchants met with him and made him abide,<br />
And shutten him in their shops to showen their ware,<br />
And parrelled him like their prentice the people to serve.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p class="p1">As for the crafts, on the other hand, whether
they were combinations of employers, or associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of middlemen or dealers, or unions of wage-earners,
or societies of masters and men, in one respect
their unanimity was unbroken; for inspired by a
reasonable hostility to the consumer who wanted to
cheapen their wares, they were all ranged on the same
side in the common controversy as to who was
ultimately to fix prices, the seller or the buyer.
Then obvious policy was declared in a number of conspiracies
which were constantly made in the various
trades to raise prices by combination among the
dealers; but unfortunately for the traders, always on
the watch as they were for opportunities, they still
found the public as alert as themselves, and more
powerful to accomplish their will. When Edward the
Third in 1331 fixed the price of wine of Gascony at 4<i>d.</i>
a gallon the retail dealers, who had apparently found
their profit best secured by the absence of any
statutory prices for their goods, broke into open
rebellion, and “all the taverners of the city making a
confederacy and alliance among them” closed the
doors of their taverns and would not allow their
wines to be sold; till to “put a check upon this
malignancy” the mayor and sheriffs proceeded
through the city, and had the names of the taverners
so closing their taverns written down, twenty-nine
in number, and twelve men from each ward of the
city were summoned by the authorities to decide in
the name of the injured wine-drinkers upon the
punishment to be awarded to the taverners for their
contumacy.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In 1363 and again in 1411 the consumer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was protected by law against the rich Pepperers
who had formed a company in 1345, and were
accused of raising prices.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The whole body of
chandlers in Norwich were presented at the Court
Leet in 1300 for a certain agreement made among
themselves that “no one of them shall sell a pound
of candles for less than another.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> And in 1329 when
a lime-burner of London bound all the members of his
trade by oath not to sell lime below a fixed price,
and “by reason of his great conspiracy” almost
doubled the price of lime, the city rulers imprisoned
him and the “conspiracy” was cut short.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Alliances of this kind to increase profits or raise
prices were universally met by a determined resistance
on the part of the public.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> But the “poor
commons” went far beyond a policy of mere self-defence.
They aimed in fact at nothing less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
putting the crafts altogether under the yoke of the
community, at seizing the whole organization of
trade which had been built up and binding it over to
perpetual service. Nothing could have been more
distasteful to the guilds. In the twelfth century,
while municipal government was in its very infancy,
they had already aimed at complete independence and
a real autonomy; and certain crafts did in fact succeed
in making a special bargain with the King over the
heads of the local magistrates. By charters bought
at Westminster fraternities were made dependent
for their existence on the royal will alone; and were
granted rights of supervision and jurisdiction over
their workmen without any reference to the borough;<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
and since in these early charters the only definite
provision was that all the men of the trade in that
particular district should be enrolled in the guild, the
freedom of the craft as a whole remained for the
moment unquestioned even if the freedom of the
individual was limited. An independence so complete
however was bitterly resented by town governments.
In London for example the weavers lived in a
quarter by themselves into which the city officers never
entered. They had their own courts and special privileges,
and raised their taxes through their own officers.
Under the protection of the King’s writ they successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
defied the town authorities, and when in the
time of Henry the Third the citizens seemed likely to
overpower them by force they laid up their charter of
rights in the Exchequer as a perpetual record of their
privileges. The jealousy excited in municipal bodies
by an alien society settled in their midst, where the
town writs did not run, is not surprising. Every
interest of the city was threatened&mdash;the monopoly of
the sale of cloth claimed by the burgesses, the
authority of the town magistrates, the orderly system
of administration which the kings were building up,
and the interests of the whole body of consumers.
A natural apprehension of any danger to the unity
of the borough was shown not only in London, but in
Winchester, Oxford, Marlborough, Beverley,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and
possibly in other towns; the weavers were shut out of
the franchise and all its privileges, hampered in their
trade by all sorts of oppressive regulations, forbidden
to buy their tools, or possess any wealth, or sell their
goods save to freemen of the city, while the status of
villeins and aliens in the city courts was allotted to
them. But mere repression left the real evil untouched;
and by 1300 the city authorities in London
had found a more radical cure. The Mayor had
gained the right to preside in the weavers’ court if he
chose, and to nominate the wardens of the guild;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
and no sooner was all danger from an independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
rule thus averted than the weavers were granted
power to buy and sell “like other free citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>From this time all independent trade jurisdictions
in the towns came to an end.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> No more charters such
as that of the weavers were sold by the crown;<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
and the crafts were presently forced to conciliate
the local powers according to their measure of art or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cunning&mdash;to beg from the municipal government a
formal recognition for their association with such
limited liberties as the town officers could be induced
to give; to secure a more or less precarious existence
by the payment of fines to the town treasury;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> or
to wrap round them a solemn conventional disguise,
and conceal wholly or in part the fact of their union
for trade purposes by sheltering themselves under the
form of a religious association, and seeking independence
“under a feigned colour of sanctity”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> as men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wholly moved by a zealous care for the souls of their
dead comrades but taking no thought for the bodily
welfare of living brethren.</p>

<p>But by whatever means the fraternities hoped to
compass liberty, it was in vain that they sought to
elude the heavy hand of the municipal government.
Trade associations were laid hold of by the boroughs,
brought under the discipline and authority of the
public magistrates, and forced to take their due part
in the developement of the municipal organisation.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Towns which obtained a grant to have “all reasonable
guilds” took care to maintain a reasonable
authority, and craft fraternities were only given
leave to exist on the express plea that they were
“consonant with reason and redounding to the public
honour and to the advantage of the common weal”;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
while privileges were meted out to them on the distinct
understanding of the gain which was to spring
from these to the whole commonalty. By a dexterous
move on the part of the town governors the
officers of the guild were transformed into the officers
of the community, and the machinery of the guild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
became the means by which the public sought to
provide for a full and cheap supply of the necessaries
of life, and protected itself from overcharges and false
measures and bad wares, from uproar and disorder,
from drunken workmen, from the flying sparks of the
smith’s forge, or the noise of his hammer at night.
In London for example there was a constant succession
of customers complaining at the Mayor’s Court
of the bad bargains they had made in buying cloth,
so that the fullers found themselves excessively
“hard worked” in appearing at the Guildhall to
examine the cloths of discontented buyers, and
begged that every one might buy at his own
risk.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The masterly manœuvre executed by the town
magistrates is revealed in the self-denying ordinances
passed by the later guilds. Crafts “petition,” as we
are gravely told, to have masters and ordinances,
and these being granted the new rules turn out to
be simply regulations to supply wares to the people
of a fixed quality and price.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> We can scarcely
believe that the farriers should of their own free
will have devised the rule that if any one of them,
through negligence or any excess of pride which
hindered his asking advice of the craft, failed in
curing a horse of sickness, “then he shall be accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
thereof before the Mayor and Aldermen and be
punished at their discretion, in the way of making
restitution for such horse to the person to whom the
same belongs.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Nor is it likely that masons and
carpenters should have volunteered to take oath
before Mayor and Aldermen that they would do their
duty in their trade;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> or that the masons should
themselves propose that if a mason failed to fulfil his
contract certain men of the trade who acted as his
securities should be bound to finish his task.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Even
the universal rule against night work was never
among the London guilds (save in the single instance
of the hat-makers)<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> made in the interest of the
working-man; but on the contrary was dictated by
the sagacious observation of the buyers that “sight is
not so profitable by night, or so certain, as by day&mdash;<i>to
the profit, that is, of the community</i>;”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and if
spurriers “who compass how to practise deception
in their work desire to work by night rather than by
day”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> the reason given for interfering with them was
that they wandered about all day idle, and “then
when they have become drunk and frantic they take
to their work to the annoyance of the sick and
all their neighbourhood ... and then they blow
up their fires so vigorously that their forges begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
all at once to blaze ... and all the neighbours
are much in dread of the sparks which so vigorously
issue forth in all directions from the mouths of the
chimneys in their forges.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Sunday closing itself
was ordered as a matter of public convenience, because
apprentices “could not be trusted to carry on
work in the absence of their masters at church.”<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>In thus bringing the crafts into subjection the
towns were greatly strengthened by the sympathy
of the State, which was the more inclined to make
common cause with them from a growing apprehension
of guilds of artificers and other labourers which
in troubled times might prove centres of disturbance
throughout the country. By a series of statutes the
ancient powers of crafts were carefully pruned, and
new authority grafted on to the town governments.
“Congregations and confederacies” were jealously
watched and forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The guilds were ordered to
have their charters registered, and their rules and bye-laws
approved by the chief magistrates of the town.
They were forbidden to make ordinances to the
damage of the King or the people. Sometimes
jurisdiction over their own members was taken
from them; and the right of search for any articles
that “be not pure lawful and able chaffers,” or
even the duty of seeing that the workers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
duly paid their wages in ready money, was
handed over to the town officers.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Thus it came about that by the triple alliance
of the officials at Westminster with the governing
class of the town and the general body of consumers,
all alike bent on organizing industry in their
several interests, the primitive free associations of
workers were gradually forced into the singular position
of deferential servants of the community.
Within its own little realm each guild might use
a narrow independence or a petty tyranny, but in
its public aspect it could assert few pretensions.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
No craft fraternity could be formed without the leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the municipality, and every Warden took his
oath of office before the Mayor, at whose bidding
and subject to whose approval he had been elected.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
The rules made by any trade for its government
had no force till they had been approved by the
Mayor and Corporation, enrolled by them on the
city records, and sealed with the common seal.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
And since they reserved the right of making any
addition to these ordinances which they might deem
necessary,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> the town magistrates could interfere whenever
they chose in the interests of order. Not only
did they bear rule over the seller in the market, but
they followed the craftsman to his little workroom and
ordered every smallest detail of his trade, material,
wages, apprentices, cost, the fit of a coat and the
quality of a shoe, according to the laws that “reserved
all time to the Mayor and to the Council of
the town power to correct, to punish, amerce, and
redress, as well the masters and all other persons of
the said crafts, each after their deserving and trespass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
as the case asketh.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Men who offended against the
rules of the trade were brought before the town
officers for punishment, and half their fines went into
the town treasury.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Even the wandering artizans who
moved from place to place, who had no fixed shops and
no complete guild organization, found themselves
subjected to the town authorities as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had crossed the borders of the borough. Carpenters,
masons, plasterers, daubers, tilers, and paviours
had to take whatever wages the law decreed and
to accept the supervision of the municipal rulers,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
and their regulations were framed according to
the convenience of the borough. Thus after the
big storm of 1362 in London they were forbidden
to raise their prices for repairing the citizens’ roofs;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
and the same ordinances of Worcester which direct
that chimneys of timber and thatched houses should
be done away with, and stone or brick chimneys
and tiled roofs everywhere made by midsummer
day, contain regulations for the tilers who must
have flocked to the city on such an occasion. They
must set up no parliament to make any one of
them “as a master and all other tilers to be as
his servant and at his commandment, but that
every tiler be free to come and go to work
with every man and citizen freely as they may
accord.” No stranger tiler coming to the city was
to be forced to work for any city tiler, but might
take whatever work he liked by the day.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The rapidity with which the whole movement was
conceived and carried out is one of the most surprising
things about it; and nothing was wanting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the thoroughness with which mediæval society
carried out its theory of the use which the craft
guilds might be made to serve, whether willingly
or no, in protecting the interests of the public. One
discovery followed on another. As the King for
convenience of administration constantly delegated
new powers to the Mayor, and successive Acts and
Charters added to his load of responsibilities for
supervising work and wages and wares, so the Mayor
in his turn passed on these charges to the craft&mdash;apparently
exalting its power, in reality undermining
its independence. Town governors embarrassed by
the difficulty of overawing a turbulent community
and keeping the peace with the aid of a couple of
constables, found in the guild organization an
admirable machinery all ready to their hands, and
turned its officers, responsible as they were for the
good behaviour and order of the whole trade, into
an effective city police; so that when Bristol was
in danger of a general riot in consequence of the
imprisonment of its Mayor, the sheriff and recorder
simply summoned the masters of the various crafts,
and ordered them to keep the peace in their several
trades. In the same way the crafts might be charged
with the duty of “setting the watch” at night.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Difficulties
of taxation were lightened by shifting responsibility
from the municipal officers to the guilds&mdash;by
charging for example the bakers or blanket-makers
or fullers with a certain proportion of the
ferm, to be collected among their members and paid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by their officers.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> If walls were to be repaired and
gates and towers and piers maintained, or if the
expenses of a public festival were to be met,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> the
craft might again be brought into use, and for the
due performance of the allotted task their common
funds or individual profits might be reckoned as
security.</p>

<p>When the town had thus laid firm hold on
the guilds and discovered the various uses to
which these bodies might be put in the municipal
scheme, it began to look on them with as
much favour as it had formerly shown distrust,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and proceeded industriously to multiply their
numbers both by creating new fraternities and
reorganizing the old ones.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The public opinion
of the day showed itself strongly in favour of guilds,
and indeed often outran the desires of the workin-gmen,
so that the drawing together of artizans into the
later craft fraternities was not always a matter of
free will. If trades did not associate at their own
wish they were presently forced to do so, and at
the end of the fifteenth century we find the towns
everywhere issuing orders that crafts which had
hitherto escaped should be compelled to group themselves
into companies. In Sandwich, for example,
barbers, surgeons, and wax-chandlers were incorporated
in 1482; and in 1494 wardens were appointed of
the companies of tailors, shoemakers, weavers, and
shearmen.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In Canterbury, where a spirit of revolt
against the rules of the corporation seems to have
gone abroad, where strangers were setting up trades
within the liberties and laws had to be made to
insure their paying “reasonable fine” for so doing,
where masters neglected to enroll their apprentices
in the books of the Common Chamber, and where
the servants in husbandry riotously resisted the
Statute of Labourers, the outraged city authorities
declared that the crafts needed new regulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
“to maintain due order for the weal and increase of
the same,” and set to work to tighten the hold of
the government on manufacturer and artizan, by
forcing the trades to form themselves into companies,
and setting at the head of every craft or
mystery two of the city aldermen.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> In very
many cases the later incorporation of trades was
connected with a pledge to undertake certain town
works such as the building or repairing of gates;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
and here we probably find the clue to the growing
custom of combining several poor societies into
one substantial association. When the crafts of
Canterbury began to grudge spending their money
on the Corpus Christi Play and on the Pageant
of St. Thomas (which had to be revived in 1504
and paid for by the corporation), and also neglected
“setting the watch,” the Town Council would have
none of the excuse of poverty, only made “for
lack of good ordering of certain crafts within the
same city not corporate”; and it was settled that
every trade “being not corporate for the nonsufficience
of their craft be associate, incorporate,
and adjoining to some other craft most needing
support, if they will not labour to be corporate
within themselves”; any obstinate craft that did
not make suit to the Burghmote by next Michaelmas
to be incorporate was to pay 20<i>s.</i> and give
up their bodies for punishment. The shoemakers
were accordingly joined in one guild with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
leather-sellers and pouchmakers, the apothecaries
with the grocers and chandlers.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>But if the town carried on business in this high-handed
and imperious fashion, still in the double
bargain made between the municipalities and the
crafts it is not to be supposed that the advantage
was all on one side. If the guild had services to sell
to the community, it in its turn demanded a fair
price. The trading society received all the benefits
which fall upon communities by law established;
and municipalities fostered with tender care the
fraternities whose discipline they had first seized
into their hands.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> If trade was reaching out its
branches to markets beyond the sea or if it was
withering away, if the serving-men were growing poor
or if they were waxing prosperous and threatening
to dictate wages and prices, if new machinery
was introduced to replace human labour, if foreign
craftsmen came in to supplant the home-bred artizan&mdash;whatever
the trouble might be the government
of the people bravely stepped in to set the matter
right. Craft rules once entered on the city records
became an admitted part of the city statutes, to
be enforced by the authority of the whole community,
and the master found his jurisdiction recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and enforced, and might call on the mayor,
“if the men are rebels or contrarious and will
not work,” to deal with them “according to law
and reason.”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> The whole strength of the town
government could be invoked to suppress “foreign”
labour or alien dealers and manufacturers, or
combinations of men against their employers.
No remedy was too heroic for patriotic burghers if
they thought the prosperity of the local manufacturers
was in danger. When the cloth trade
of Canterbury had fallen into an evil plight the
Town Council passed a law ordaining that in the
next year the mayor and each of the twelve aldermen
should buy a certain amount of cloth, the
forty-eight councillors one-half that amount, and
certain well-to-do inhabitants a like measure according
to their degree.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The system in fact was a curious balance of
compromise among three distinct parties to a triangular
strife&mdash;the whole body of traders and manufacturers
organized in craft guilds, whose primary
object was naturally to secure “their own singular
profit,” as the phrase went, and to take on themselves
as few of the common burdens as possible&mdash;the body
of householders organized for civic purposes as the
mayor, council, and commonalty, whose business was
to keep order and carry on government&mdash;and the
entire population of the town considered as consumers,
who were thinking only of the supply of their
own wants and whose chief aim was to buy the
trader’s goods at the lowest possible price. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
time the borough corporations and the big public had
the triumph on their side, and the traders were held
in a position which was judged to be “consonant to
reason.” But if the crafts passed through a
period of subjection while their organization and
discipline were being perfected, this by no means
implied the practice of a like humility when
they had learned how to manipulate the narrow
oligarchy that formed the corporation, and to
despise the incoherent masses that made up the
body of consumers. For all this time the guilds
were steadily, by the help of the town customs and
administration, fortifying themselves in their position,
strengthening their monopoly, closing their ranks,
shutting out competitors from their gains. There
came at last a moment when the crafts matched their
strength with that of their masters, and the municipalities
surrendered to the forces which they themselves
had drilled. How completely the mediæval
theory of the consumer’s interest in legislation about
industry was swept away by the final success of the
crafts in enforcing by their compact majority the
original purpose of their own members, we may see
from the chasm that separates in principle the
ancient trade guild from the modern trade union.
To-day we also are constantly making attempts
to regulate industry through combinations whether
of capitalists or of wage-earners. We have our
associations of employers which have grown up to
resist their workmen, and our unions of working-men
formed to fight the employers; but neither
is in the least concerned with the interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
public, and not even in a phrase of courtesy are
any of our modern associations supposed to “redound
to the common profit” of the buyers. In this
profound difference between the old and the new
organizations of industry we may find a measure
of the tremendous importance of the victory
achieved by the crafts, when they had learned to
use the disciplined forces of the guild for the capture
of the municipal government. In later times, when
public opinion almost ceased to work through the
machinery of local government and only found
occasional or incoherent expression, teaching societies
under their more modern name of companies employed
the same compact organization of monopolists to
press their claims with redoubled success on the
attention of the all-powerful central authorities, and
the protection of the consumer was more and more
forgotten in the protection of the privileged trader.</p>


<p class="pc2 mid">NOTE A.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Besides the instances which have been given of the interference
of the town with the crafts in questions that concerned
the public, or that concerned the journeymen, there were other
interesting cases in which it took part in struggles between the
guilds of artizan producers and the guilds of dealers or middlemen
for whom they worked. For the difference between the greater
and the lesser crafts must always be borne in mind, and the
fact that some of them were mere associations of working-men
whose ordinances prove their subordinate position; though except
possibly in rare instances the association was not originally
formed, or at any time mainly used, for the purpose of resisting
the middlemen.</p>

<p>The weavers in London for example who lived by themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in a special quarter of the city formed a union of independent
artizans, each of whom possessed his own loom; if by chance he became
rich enough to own a second, he set his son or his wife to work
at it, being forbidden by the craft-guild to hire it out of his own
house and so increase the number of workers. They worked for
the guild of “burellers” or cloth-makers, who gave out the yarn
which they wove into a coarse cloth, and paid them a fixed wage
or price by the piece. In very early times the weavers complained
of the bad quality and short quantity of yarn supplied to
them by the burellers, and of the prices paid for weaving; and
about 1290 they planned a whole scheme of organized resistance.
They reduced the hours of labour by stopping night-work, and
appointing seasons when no work at all might be done; they
limited the number of workers by excluding new comers and
forbidding looms to be let out on hire; and as their work was
necessarily done by the piece, they ruled that a given length
of cloth which could easily be made in two or three days should
always count as four days’ work and no less; and apparently
further devised means for making plausible overcharges for
work done. To compel the obedience of members of the guild
they ordered that any weaver who offended against these
regulations should be called up for judgement before their
governing council of twenty-four, and punished by it in formal
fashion in the same way as for offences against legal ordinances.
And to force the submission of the burellers, they commanded
a general strike among the weavers in case of complaint, and
that all work should be stopped until amends were made for the
wrong done. In the face of a public which had already fixed
prices and wages by law and considered that question finally
closed, the weavers who found themselves shut out from direct
methods of gaining their ends had thus taken the crooked way,
at least so their enemies said, of raising prices by limiting production,
and thus forcing up the price of cloth.</p>

<p>For ten years middlemen and workmen seem to have fought
out their quarrel together; but in 1300 the burellers brought
their grievances to the mayor’s court, and charged the weavers
with making new ordinances contrary to all law. There was
little sympathy in the city courts for craftsmen whose rules
were framed “for their singular profit and to the common injury
of the people,” and the jury decided that the weavers had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
right to limit the production of cheap cloth for the public by
any device whatever. They were forbidden to shorten hours of
labour by stopping work at any time save at night, or to check
manufacture by preventing weavers from hiring out their looms
to men of the craft; piece-work might be done as fast as any
weaver chose to do it; all overcharges for work were forbidden.
And lastly strikes were absolutely prohibited. In a second trial
in 1321, when the obstinate weavers were called up before the
king’s judges at the Tower, charged with making a “conspiracy
and confederation” in the Church of St. Margaret de Patyns to
raise the price of weaving each cloth by 6<i>d.</i>, the king’s serjeant,
who prosecuted, explained with precision that an unlimited
number of workers working at full speed meant low wages and
an abundance of cheap cloth, and that any attempt to reduce the
number of labourers, to bring in short hours, or slow work&mdash;every
device in fact by which the output of cloth was limited,
was a device to empty the burgher’s purse into the workman’s
pocket. In the common interest such “malicious machinations”
must needs be put down; and indeed it would seem that some
doubts were entertained about the wisdom of interfering even
with night-work if the public was to have cheap cloth. (Riley’s
Liber Custumarum, 123, 416-425.)</p>

<p>The guild, which by this time had declined from three hundred
and eighty to eighty looms, was probably never strong enough
in London to renew the strife. Perhaps the Flemish weavers
supplanted them and took up the battle, for we find that in 1362
and 1366 they in their turn were making congregations and
collecting money among the people of the trade through their
bailiffs. By the ordinances which were drawn up to meet this
emergency it was settled that in future congregations of the
workers and collections of money among them might only be
made with the consent of the twenty-four best men of the trade,
and that these twenty-four should be chosen at the discretion
of the mayor and aldermen. (Mem. Lond. 306-7, 332.)</p>

<p>A yet more complicated controversy divided the various crafts
concerned in the making of saddles, where we have the reverse case
of a union of middlemen conspiring to put under their feet the
crafts of artizans with which they were connected. The London
Saddlers who sold to the public formed as early as the twelfth
century a guild of employers and middlemen. (Madox, 26.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Of the different crafts that worked for them were the Joiners
who made the wooden framework, the fore and hind saddle-bows
cut out of a quarter of a horizontal section of a tree and hollowed
to fit the horse’s back; the Painters who painted these frames;
and the Lorimers (that is the coppersmiths and ironsmiths) who
made the metal work for the trapping and the harness of the
horses. As for the saddlers themselves they seem only to have
put the finishing touches to the saddles, or put on the leather
covering for the great lords who were not contented with painted
wood; but as all orders and all sales were carried out by them
they had the ultimate control of the whole trade.</p>

<p>The first dispute arose out of the complaints of the public of
the badness of saddles supplied to them; the saddlers threw the
blame on the joiners; and the joiners seem to have in their turn
pushed it back on an illegal or “blackleg” labour encouraged by
the saddlers for their own advantage. “Bad apprentices who fly
from their masters, and other false men, betake themselves to the
woods, and there make up their work of saddle-bows glued together
and send them by night to painters and to saddlers within
the franchise” who profited largely by the cheap labour of the
“bad apprentices” working under the cover of the woods.
The authorities forbade these practices, and in 1308 granted
to the joiners’ guild ordinances to protect their monopoly of
the trade and check irregular labour. (Lib. Cus. 80.)</p>

<p>A few years later the joiners made common cause with the
painters and lorimers&mdash;a formidable conspiracy, for the lorimers
had already been organized as a craft for half a century, and
ordinances which strictly protected their monopoly lay for safe
keeping in the city treasury. (Lib. Cus. 78-9. The lorimers
included two ranks&mdash;the master who kept house and forge and
paid fine to the commune of London; and the journeymen who
paid to the mistery but not to the city.) In 1320, however, the
saddlers contrived to have the lorimers’ ordinances annulled and
publicly burnt in Cheapside. (Lib. Cus. lix.) In 1327 the
combined trades broke out into open war one day in Cheapside
and Cripplegate, and “strongly provided with an armed force
exchanged blows and manfully began to fight.” (Riley’s Mem.
156-162.) Mayor and sheriffs came to stop the riot; the trades
were summoned to appear at the Guildhall, and complaints were
presented on both sides. The story of the saddlers was (1) that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the three trades had organized a union for strike purposes, in
case any one of them should have a quarrel with any saddler.</p>

<p>(2) That the coppersmiths were “out of their own heads” refusing
to receive any strange workman of the same trade into
their craft until he shall have made oath to conceal their misdeeds,
the implication being of course an attempt to raise prices
by limiting numbers.</p>

<p>(3) And further the joiners and painters “do set every point of
their trade at a fixed price ... by reason whereof they are
making themselves kings of the land, to the destruction of all the
people of the land and to the annihilation of the saddlers.”</p>

<p>The trades emphatically denied both the strike conspiracy and
the fixing of prices, which at all events indicates that they knew
such claims would never be conceded by the public, and formulated
their counter-charges.</p>

<p>(1) That the saddlers had formed a “conspiracy and collusion
among themselves” and bound themselves to it by oath that they
would compel the joiners, painters, and lorimers not to sell to
any one but themselves any work they did pertaining to saddlery.
The workman was thus to be bound to them hand and foot.</p>

<p>(2) That when the workmen come to ask for payment due to
them they are so bandied about among the said saddlers with
offensive words, beaten, and otherwise maltreated, that they have
no longer the daring to demand their just debts.</p>

<p>(3) That the saddlers make old saddles into new, thus cheating
the workmen of trade that ought to come to them.</p>

<p>The first charge was denied by the saddlers, but as they
promised henceforth never to make any confederacy again their
denial was scarcely conclusive. They pleaded that the sheriff’s
court was the place for questions of debt. And they promised
never again to sell old saddles for new.</p>

<p>Evidently the excitement in London over this trade dispute
was extreme, for when arbitration by the city officers was proposed,
and the crafts summoned to meet in the church of St.
Martin’s le Grand before six chosen aldermen, they arrived there
in so great multitudes and with such a concourse of people eager
to hear the solution of the great trade problem, that no business
could be done. The aldermen ordered another meeting at which
elected representatives from each craft only should attend. Six
saddlers therefore were confronted with two ironsmiths, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
coppersmiths, two painters, and two joiners; and after a day’s
discussion a new group of thirteen was chosen by the trades and
a concord was made “by the ordinance of these common friends
and presented to the mayor and aldermen.” The result was a
decided victory of the working crafts over the dealers. The nine
chief offenders among the saddlers were driven out of the trade,
and the saddlers bound in a heavy penalty never again to take
them back, to sustain them, or to help them, till they had made
peace with the crafts. (Mem. Lond. 156-162.) As to the
introduction of “blackleg” labour by the masters, it was decreed
that no stranger was to be brought into the trades till he had
been received at the husting by the assent of eight respectable
men of the craft. The regulation that no repaired work was
to be sold for new prevented another form of irregular labour,
since trades might not legally repair for any but private
customers.</p>

<p>In this instance it was the employers’ union that was beaten;
but it is evident that the question mainly turned on the convenience
of the public, and their dislike to have bad saddles
supplied to them. It is also evident that save in the case of
some unusually powerful combination of working crafts there
was but little hope for the humbler trades in a conflict with
dealers or employers backed by the public in keeping down
prices. The Tawyers or dressers of skins made ordinances in
1365 “as to how they shall serve the pelterers and how much they
shall take for their labour.” (Riley’s Mem. Lond. 330.) The
records may state that the ordinances were “provided and made
by the serving-men called tawyers,” but it is hard to believe that
these “serving-men” acted of their own free will in framing rules
which put their necks mercilessly and irrevocably under the yoke
of the pelterers, binding themselves to serve them only, to work
for the old fixed prices, and to bow to their jurisdiction in trade
offences “according to the award and discretion of the rulers of
the trade of pelterers.”</p>

<p>There were other grounds of dispute between craft and craft,
and battles raged at times between guilds as to the boundaries
of the trades, and the relations between them&mdash;disputes which
sprang from the “overlapping” of different crafts engaged upon
one and the same product; or from the “apportionment” of work
between closely related trades. Shoemakers were forbidden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
be tanners (Stat. 13 Rich. II. i. cap. 12); then allowed to tan
leather till the next Parliament (Stat. 4 Henry IV. cap. 35);
and in 1423 again forbidden to be tanners (2 Henry VI. cap.
7). And as the tanners were protected against the shoemakers,
so shoemakers were protected against cobblers. There was many
a quarrel between the cordwainers who made new boots and
the cobblers who mended old ones, the cobblers complaining that
the cordwainers were preventing them from gaining their living
as they had done of old. In 1395 at the king’s order the mayor
summoned twelve of each craft to state their grievances. The
question of how much mending might be supposed to make a
new boot required the most detailed inquiry: and the apportionment
of labour was exact. No person who meddled with old
shoes was to make new ones; all work with new leather was
declared to be within the sphere of the cordwainers, and the
cobblers were restricted to mending, and that with very small
pieces of leather. Fourteen years later the lines were drawn still
more precisely; the re-soling of old boots was reserved to the
cordwainers, but the cobblers were allowed to mend with pieces
of new leather boots that were burnt or broken. (Mem. Lond.
539-40, 572-3.) Ordinances of this kind were not necessarily
designed for the protection of the workers, though no doubt that
may often have been partly intended; but in the first instance
were probably meant to make the supervision of trades and
inspection of wares more efficient in the public interest.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TAILORS OF EXETER</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the fifteenth century, at the very time
when the towns seem to have been most energetic in
tightening the bonds that held the crafts fast to
their service, that we find the crafts on their side
most impatient of subjection, and eager to test their
strength in a direct conflict with the civic rulers.
Their restless energy broke down all barriers between
trade and politics, and forced each into the service of
the other; for by whatever stratagem the crafts
proposed to compel the constituted authorities to
recognize them in a partnership of power&mdash;whether a
wealthy guild planned the winning of a charter which
should make it a free and independent corporation in
the town; or whether a combination of less powerful
trades demanded to be officially included in the
municipal government which regulated their business,
or in any other way to control its action&mdash;in any and
every conflict with the ruling oligarchy the guilds
were forced to enlist the sympathy of the burghers
and to become leaders of popular discontent. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
other hand the commons, with no resource against
the official class save an occasional mass meeting,
eagerly welcomed the aid of the disciplined army
enrolled in the guild, and under the politic guidance
of expert leaders, to give weight to their claims for
more power. Thus under the stress of the growing
passion for political emancipation, trading interests
constantly seem to merge altogether into the
ambitions and animosities of parties wholly occupied
in a conflict about civic rights. No doubt a prevailing
suspicion of some such intimate connection
between the desire of the crafts to escape from municipal
control and a democratic movement in city
politics, gave fire to the discussions which from the
first origin of the question disturbed market-place
and council-chamber, law-court and Parliament, and
proclaimed the vehemence of feeling with which
so great a matter was debated.</p>

<p>In the Tailors’ Fraternity of Exeter we have a
very curious example of the part which the Guild
organization played in municipal politics. We have
already seen the optimistic view taken by the Mayor
and his Fellowship of “the great commonalty of the
city,” united and harmonious, and worthily represented
by the patriotic officers into whose hands
an absolute and unquestioned power had been committed;
so that when John Shillingford sends
to the Recorder and the Fellowship an account of his
doings in London in the matter of the Dean and
Chapter, he simply begs them first to make such corrections
as they saw fit, and adds, “This done I pray
you to call before you at the Hall the substance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the commonalty praying every one of them in my
name and charging them in the most straightest
wise in the King’s behalf to come before you in haste
for the tidings that I have sent home to you; and
that ye wisely declare before them these answers;
so that they say manly yea and nay <i>in such points
as you think to be done</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Throughout the whole of
the Mayor’s letters there is not the slightest
indication that he had ever heard of any “impetuous
clamours” of a revolutionary Exeter mob, little
mindful of the honour of the city; nor that after a
hundred years or more of gathering discontent a
crisis was close at hand when the commonalty was
to measure its strength against the corporation.
Nevertheless the union of the moment was but the
union that comes of confronting a common enemy;
and the townsmen seemed to be only waiting till that
strife was temporarily hushed to fling themselves
again into the discussion of their own domestic
differences.</p>

<p>It is probable that from the time when the people
of Exeter began to elect their own mayor, bailiff, and
eight aldermen of the wards, they were also accustomed
to appoint a body of twelve men to aid the
mayor in all difficult business.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> As at Colchester,
Norwich, and many other towns, the elections were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
made by a double jury of Twenty-four; but how the
Twenty-four were themselves elected we do not
know. In the fourteenth century they seem already
established, like the Twenty-four of Norwich, as a
permanent council to advise and assist the Mayor;
but the Twelve apparently survived alongside of
them, for freemen were forbidden to assemble for the
election of a mayor “in the absence of the Thirty-six”;
and the Twenty-four were unable to perform
any act save in the presence of Twelve men.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Until
the records of Exeter are published, however,
it is impossible to define the relations of the two
bodies; and the manner in which the Twenty-four
took possession of the Council Chamber is unknown.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>In Exeter, as elsewhere, trouble broke out in the
middle of the fourteenth century between the two
factions of the community&mdash;between the commons,
discontented and rebellious; and the governing class,
who appear, not as innovators or usurpers, but as the
conservative guardians of “the ancient orders and
customs of the city.” The quarrel began in 1339
with “impetuous clamours” of the people against the
constant re-election of one or two men as mayors;
and for one year at least they carried their point,
perhaps by some breach of former customs of
election, for a decree was immediately issued that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the people were not to gather together on the day of
the mayor’s election “in the absence of the Thirty-six”;
perhaps by some help from the Church and
from country patrons, for it was further ordered that
no clerk of the Consistory Court, nor any man who did
not live in the city should be elected mayor or
allowed in any way to meddle with the election.
The decree that no burgher might be excluded from the
office who was resident, had been seneschal and had the
hundred shillings of property which was generally
required in all boroughs was, if we may judge from
other boroughs, simply a recapitulation of the common
custom.</p>

<p>That the quarrel was still agitating the people’s
minds some years later is shown by the ordinances
of 1346 and 1347. The first forbade that a mayor
should be immediately re-elected&mdash;an order evidently
made to quiet public opinion but which the Twenty-four
had no intention of observing. The second
ordinance of 1347 decreed that the election should be
made “by Twenty-four persons who upon their
several and respective oaths shall make the election”&mdash;in
fact it declared anew the custom which had been
already recognized for fifty years, and probably from
the first institution of the office, though of late years
it had been called in question.</p>

<p>The victory of the governing body was apparently
complete,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and it was indeed inevitable that so long
as the city had to keep up its struggle with Earl and
Bishop the needs and discipline of war should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
strengthen the position of the leaders and tighten
their hold on their fellow-citizens. In 1427 the
Twenty-four appear with the name of “the Common
Council,” ordinances are issued in the name of “the
Mayor and the Common Council,” and “in open
court the Mayor and Bailiffs by the assent of the
Twenty-four” transact all manner of town business,
whether it concerned the city franchise, the hearing
and carrying out of the King’s orders, or the voting
of money for public purposes.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> To them also undoubtedly
Shillingford wrote his long letters from
London, respectfully addressing them as the “Fellowship”
or “his Fellows,” with whom he was accustomed
to take counsel.</p>

<p>The ordinary burgesses of Exeter therefore, so far
back as we can trace its history, played a modest part
in city politics, nor had their attempt to assert themselves
in 1339 won for them any advantage whatever.
In 1460 the townsfolk made a new effort of a
different and singularly interesting kind.</p>

<p>There was in Exeter a certain Tailors’ Guild. Its
rules, written or copied in 1460, ordained that every
full tailor worth £20 “shall be of the Master’s
Fellowship and Clothing” and pay as his entrance “a
spoon of silver weighing one ounce and the fashion,”
besides buying a livery once a year and giving twelve
pence to the yearly feast. Other shop-holders were
entered as of the Fellowship of the Bachelors, each
paying 8<i>d.</i> to the feast and his offering.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
special charges for the “free sewers”; and every
servant who took wages was also brought into the
organization and had to pay his sixpence yearly to
the Guild.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The master and wardens sat every
Thursday at nine o’clock to do business, and general
meetings of the wardens and shop-holders were held
four times a year, where after they had dined the
free sewers were given the remains of the feast. There
was a council of Eight;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and the usual rules for protecting
the trade monopoly, for maintaining discipline,
and for collecting funds were made.</p>

<p>So far the Guild was as other Guilds. But rich,
powerful, and well drilled, it cherished ambitions
beyond the perfecting of the tailors’ art.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In the
struggle between York and Lancaster, the sympathies
of official Exeter were apparently Lancastrian, and
when Edward the Fourth came to the throne<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> he
probably found it politic or necessary, by a generous
grant to the Tailors’ Company, to make friends of
the trading classes that had been left outside the
governing caste. By the charter of incorporation
which he allowed them they were granted singular
privileges, of a kind which the municipal government
bitterly resented. The charter placed the
guild in direct dependence on the King, not on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
mayor. They were given a rare liberty&mdash;the right
“to make ordinances among themselves, as to them
might beseem most necessary and behovefull for the
said fraternity,” and to “make search” and correct
faults, apparently without need of the mayor’s sanction.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
Not only so, but they obtained authority to
“augment and enlarge” their Guild as they chose;
and did forthwith begin daily to take into their company
“divers crafts other than of themselves, and
divers others not inhabitants within the same city”&mdash;men
in fact of every conceivable trade and occupation,
free brethren who swore to be true and loving
brothers of the guild, never to go to law with any
of the fraternity, to pay their fines duly during life
to the treasure box, and leave a legacy to it at their
death. The usual rule that no man of the craft
could be admitted to the freedom of the city save by
the consent of the master and wardens gained a new
political significance when the bulk of the inhabitants
were thus enrolled under the Tailors’ Guild, and
when consequently it was the master of the Tailors
who decided what men should or should not be made
free of the borough.</p>

<p>From this moment the Tailors’ Guild was really a
great political association. The Master and Fellowship
of the company were scarcely less powerful than the
Mayor and Fellowship of the Corporation. By their
right of search the guild officers could enter by day or
night almost any house in the city or suburbs. By
their authority to amend defaults they were able to
leave the city courts deserted and the city treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
empty of its accustomed fines. The granting of
citizenship was practically in their hands. Their
funds and organization afforded the means for a steady
and ordered attack on the governing oligarchy.
Taking into their ranks all crafts and all classes, they
gathered into one body the overtaxed and discontented
populace whose anger at the authorities had grown
big with long suppression; while they also enlisted
members that lay beyond the authority of the corporation&mdash;country
people as well as church tenants who,
as we know, were already murmuring at the assessing
of their taxes, and prepared to make common cause
with the burghers.</p>

<p>Up to this time the authority of the Mayor over
the trades of Exeter had been unquestioned.
Merchants, grocers, drapers, mercers, the tailors themselves
had been subject to his rule as in other towns;
till by this alarming conspiracy the Mayor and
Fellowship found themselves confronted with what
naturally seemed to them a “great disorderly body”
of revolutionists, who held conventicles and stirred up
commotions in the town, who even overawed the
Mayor and threatened to destroy his authority&mdash;men
of “such evil disposition and unpeaceable that the
Mayor of the said city may not guide and rule the
people ... nor correct such defaults as ought by
him to be correct,” so that “evil example” was
“likely to grow to subversion and destruction of the
same city.”<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The royal charter obtained by the Guild
was looked upon by the Corporation as a breach of
municipal privilege; and the Guild members were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
required to renounce it by oath or to lose the city
franchise; while the Mayor made an example of some
of the burgesses who belonged to the fraternity by
striking them off the roll of citizens. The shop
windows of the refractory were fastened down, and
inhabitants were forbidden to have garments made by
certain tailors whose names were set down in a black
list, “nor with no other of their opinion.” Members
of the craft who were on the city council were refused
the Christmas gifts of wine and canon bread given to
the councillors, and if they held to the craft were indeed
excluded from the Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> On the other hand
if a luckless inhabitant sought to make his peace with
the Corporation by withdrawing from the Tailors, and
swearing upon the Crucifix and the Holy Evangelists
to renounce their charter as contrary to the liberties
of the city, the armed brethren of the Guild visited
his house and levied his contributions by force of arms,
that is to say by jacks, doublets of defence, swords,
bucklers, glaives, and stones.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Then the town officers
retorted by “presenting” the guilty tailors at the next
court for the crime of riotously collecting fees, and
throwing them into prison; and so the war went on,
evidently at the expense of the weakest members of
the community.</p>

<p>Presently however the quarrel was carried beyond
the city courts. The Corporation appealed to Westminster
and was once more plunged into legal expenses.
In 1477 both parties appeared by attorneys before
Edward the Fourth, who used the opportunity of
the strife to tighten the hold of the central authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
both on the town and on the craft. He set aside the
contention of Exeter that the Corporation had any
exclusive right of granting charters: the Guild had
received its incorporation from the King and this
remained valid; and in future all disputes between
city and guild were to be laid before the King and his
Council. But the royal rights being thus secured, the
sympathy of the central government veered round to
the side of the town as against the craft; and the conditions
imposed on the Guild if it would preserve its
charter were such as must necessarily break up the
organization in its actual form. The fraternity was
cut down again to the limits of the tailors’ trade, and
might enlist no members and make no search among
those of other occupations, nor beyond the city boundaries;
and even within these limits “saving always
the franchises of the Mayor and Commonalty.” It
might issue no order against the rights of Bishop or
Mayor: nor might it admit any man to the freedom
of the city by enrolling him in the craft unless he
were first presented to the Mayor. They suffered
indeed a yet further humiliation, for while the Mayor
was given the right of refusing to accept a candidate
if he were suspected of not being of good disposition
or conversation; yet if the master and wardens
attempted to prevent a man from gaining the freedom
of the city by refusing to testify in his favour
and to make him free of the craft, the Mayor, bailiffs,
and common council might insist on his being accepted
by the Guild.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Provisions such as these, involving the dissolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the actual fraternity as it then existed, the ruin of
its political position, and the end of its control over
the roll of burgesses, proclaimed the triumph of the
municipal authorities; and “the malice and grief
which was conceived thereof could not in long time
be satisfied or appeased.” The Guild indeed apparently
refused to accept defeat; for ordinances were
made in 1479 requiring fresh contributions fixed for
seven years from masters, shop-holders, and free
sewers “to the finding of a priest”<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>&mdash;contributions
which were assessed so high as to suggest some
“feigned colour of sanctity” in the desire to provide
for a chaplain so unwonted an opulence, in addition to
his board at the Mayor’s cost; and which evidently
lasted beyond the seven years, since in 1500 an order
was again made that all serving-men, whether working
by the year, by the week, or by the piece, should pay
a penny a quarter to maintain the priest, and at
Michaelmas for the wax. The Guild indeed was still
in good repute and able to hold its own. One of the
Tailors was Mayor before 1482;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and in 1481 the
Company arrogantly defied the authority of the
Corporation. A tailor summoned to choose between
keeping his place as member of the Guild and retaining
the freedom of the city solemnly renounced his oath
to the Guild before the Mayor, whereupon the master
and wardens sued him for perjury; so “by the mean
of gentlemen and money” he made peace with them
and was again sworn to the Guild. But absenting
himself from the duties it required of him “without
cause reasonable” he was fetched out of his house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
brought to Tailors’ Hall and set in the stocks, and
finally compelled to find sureties for good conduct in
the future.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The town councillors of Exeter learned
caution from such incidents; and when in this same
year they granted to the Cordwainers a confirmation
of their charter, it was on condition that the master
and wardens of the guild should yearly come before
the Mayor and surrender all their powers, after which
on payment of a fine they should receive them back
again by grant of the Mayor.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The next year, 1482,
when the Bakers desired to have new ordinances,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> the
Corporation stipulated that all corn must be ground
in the city mills; that the wardens in making search
in bakers’ shops or in hucksters’ houses should always
be accompanied by a city officer or serjeant; and that
if any guild rules were made which were against the
city liberties, the Mayor and council might change
them at their will.</p>

<p>The rebellious Tailors, however, had fought their
last battle. In 1482 a new petition was laid by the
city authorities before Edward the Fourth praying, in
spite of the King’s award, for the total abolition of
the Tailors’ charter; and the Twenty-four voted in this
and the following years over £50 for business in Parliament
and legal expenses “touching the annulling
of the charter.”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> From the history of other towns
about this time, it would seem that considerable
anxiety was beginning to grow up at Court as to the
commotions of the populace and the growth of democracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in the boroughs; the petition was granted as a
matter of course, and the Tailors’ Fraternity sank back
into the subject position of an ordinary craft guild.
Discontent and murmurings were still heard in the
city streets, but the corporation had no reason for
fear. In 1496 when one John Atwill was about to be
chosen for the fifth time, “a great division happened
amongst the citizens about the election of the mayor,
and for avoiding the like for the future, was
ordered by the mayor and common council hereof,
that no man should be mayor or bear any office here,
nor any election hold good, unless the same were
held according to the ancient orders and customs of
the said city, and withal that the Mayor and four and
twenty of the said Common Council should elect the
Mayor and all other officers of the said city.” To
make matters quite safe the city got a charter the
next year from Henry the Seventh. The new charter
did indeed slightly limit the claims which the
Council had freely set forth in 1496: they were no
longer allowed to elect the Mayor, but were to choose
two candidates for the office, one of whom was to be
appointed by the freemen; but on the other hand
they still retained absolute power to fill up their own
vacancies, and to choose the bailiffs. Their name too
was for the first time recognized, and instead of
using any longer the old style of the city, “the
Mayor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty of the city,” the king
legislated “by the assent and consent of the Common
Council.”<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>The Tailors, thus beaten in open fight, could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
fall back on the indirect influence of their wealth
and compact majority, and make alliance with the
power which they could not destroy. In 1516 the
Master of the craft was also Steward of the city,
another member was Receiver or Treasurer, and
others were of the Council of Twenty-four; while
others again had been Mayors or Treasurers of past
years. By the will and consent of these officers of
City and Guild, the constitution of the Tailors’ Company
was amended, so as to blot out the last trace of
government by the will of the fraternity; and the
Eight men, “the sent of the occupation,” by whose
authority laws had once been made for the trade,
were replaced by a council of those who had once
been masters of the craft, to be summoned by the
Master.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The full significance of this step can only
be understood by taking it in connexion with the
position which was at this time being given to “the
Clothing” in municipal government.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> But it is
plain that the ancient strife was now closed by a
division of the spoils of power; and the sorrows of
defeat were left to the populace at large. These lay
more hopelessly than before at the mercy of their
rulers, for masters of crafts when they controlled
town government had a double reason for maintaining
the authority of the corporation&mdash;the instinct
of the master tradesman and the instinct of the
town councillor.</p>

<p>The story of Exeter is invaluable from the light it
throws on the mutual attitude of town and craft in the
struggle for autonomy. Nothing is more intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
than the passionate resistance of a corporation to
royal charters given over the heads of the town
officers,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> if we realize the quick alarms to which a
municipality which had had experience of the long
fight for supremacy with king and church and baron,
was liable when it saw a new enemy, an enemy which
it had long supposed vanquished, springing up in its
very midst to threaten with a fresh danger the unity
of the borough. It was speedily discovered how
great an internal weakness must follow from this
cleavage in the political society of the towns;
and how the very appeals for arbitration to the
State, and the interference of King and Parliament,
must constantly tend yet further to limit
municipal independence; while there were other
hints of danger in the new chances offered for the
country gentry to interfere with the independence of
the town life, when they could make the guild,
detached from the town, an engine for their own
political projects.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Even for the guilds themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
there were to be set against the advantages, whatever
these amounted to, which they actually won by
emancipation, grave dangers for the future&mdash;dangers
from the difficulty of enforcing discipline without
government support; from the hostility of the corporation
and the annoyances it could inflict by
rendering honour to their most unruly members; and
from the encouragement given to a more aggressive
animosity on the part of other companies, rivals in
independence and determined foes in monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
The emancipation of the greater trading companies
from local control may have been a necessary step in
setting free a growing national commerce; but it
was the evident sign that the age of municipal
freedom and local self-government had entered on its
decline.</p>

<p>Usually, however, it seems that the big trading
companies had their own methods of making terms
with authority, or of leading the corporation captive and
peacefully installing themselves in the place of power;
as we may see in the case of the great merchant
fraternities and wholesale dealers who, like the Drapers
and Mercers of Coventry, the Drapers of Shrewsbury,
and possibly guilds of the same kind at Walsall,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
had made of their combinations the dictators of the
civic administration. But commercial unions such as
these, standing in a group by themselves, somewhat
apart from the Exeter Tailors, must be separately
considered. The Tailors’ fraternity may perhaps be
taken as holding a sort of intermediate position&mdash;on
one side figuring almost as a merchant company, and
on the other as an ordinary manufacturing craft;
and it is in this second aspect that its history
indicates to us the very important part which the
trades played in rallying the elements of revolt,
drilling their forces, and lending the guild organization
for the strife. No single instance can ever be
taken as in any way typical or representative, for
everywhere the position of the crafts resolves itself
into questions of local circumstances, and of delicate
changes from place to place in the balance of conflicting
forces. Whether there was any town under
normal conditions in which successful resistance was
made to a governing oligarchy save with the help of
a good craft organization we cannot as yet say. In
every borough there seem to have been disputes,
more or less acute, between the governing and the
governed, whether the conflict took the form of the
attack and defence of a close corporation as at
Exeter; or of a powerful guild merchant controlling
the corporation as at Lynn; or of the great mercantile
fraternities as at Coventry. And in some
boroughs in which the commons succeeded in modifying
the old oligarchic system, we can certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
trace the direct action of the manufacturing crafts.
Occasionally the working trades rose against the
merchant societies, and forced their way into the
Council Chamber. In Carlisle the Merchant Guild,
while remaining distinct from the municipal body,
gave to the town more mayors and aldermen than any
other guild; and as it admitted no strangers to membership
of its society “for no money whatsoever”<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
its posts and honours became practically hereditary,
until eight crafts or occupations of the town (seven
of them being unions of artificers, and the eighth
a union of shopkeepers, seedsmen, apothecaries,
haberdashers, and so on) put an end to this
despotism in the sixteenth century by creating a
council of thirty-two, four from each trade, who
joined the council of the mayor and aldermen,
and claiming to act in the name of the whole
community took part in making bye-laws; in
choosing the “out-men” who were to be made
burgesses; in auditing accounts; in removing the
town officers if necessary; and in keeping the keys of
the common chest.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> That such powers as these were
voluntarily or even quite peaceably handed over by
the ruling guild is conceivable, though its improbability
is shewn by all analogy. In Newcastle it
was after “great commotions, unlawful assemblies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
confederacies,” and general riots that the mercers,
drapers, and corn-dealers were forced in 1516 to
admit nine other crafts to share with them the
government.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> In Norwich, where it was found
possible even for guilds proscribed and forbidden
to force an honourable compromise with their
opponents, the settlement was only brought about
after discords by which the city was “divided and
dissolved and in point to have been destroyed.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
When Edward the Fourth, in 1464, sent a royal
patent to York ordering that for the future the
craftsmen of the trades should nominate two aldermen,
one of whom was to be chosen mayor, the
action must imply that there had been dissension in
the city society, out of which the king perhaps
hoped to make his profit<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> by attaching to himself
an important faction in the community. No doubt
there were many cases where the trades had to confess
the entire failure of their attempts, or where their
success was but partial, as in London where the
crafts would willingly have increased their influence
if popular opinion could have been taken out of the
way.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> In a great number of boroughs we know that
the crafts insisted that the only way to the municipal
franchise should lie through their societies;<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
what extent this condition prevailed, to what political
uses it was put, and how far it served as a trial of
strength between parties in power and revolutionary
factions, are as yet only matters of guess-work.</p>

<p>The scanty state of our knowledge indeed makes it
impossible to sum up in a phrase the character of a
strife which was universal, which involved every class
in a most complicated and highly organized industrial
society, and of which the history has not yet been
fully made out for a single borough. But so far as
our evidence yet goes, the developement of municipal
government involved everywhere a struggle between
the classes triumphant and the classes put under subjection.
To discuss whether the subject class who
attempted to create new associations or use old ones
to fight their battles, were mere common burgesses
contending with a municipal corporation, or bodies of
artificers resisting a guild of merchants, or an indiscriminate
mob opposed to a religious fraternity of
the Holy Trinity or the Holy Cross, is often a mere
juggling with words. For as we shall see, it was
possible for one group of men to bear the three names,
and in their character of “magnates” or “potentiores”
to act not only as the Town Council but also
as the Guild Merchant; and to shelter both functions
under a specious colour of sanctity. Under such
circumstances it is of no great consequence under
which name they fought, nor by what name
they called the mob, whether commonalty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
another; since no change in their nominal relations
materially affected the attitude of men in power
towards those outside, or the policy of merchant and
master tradesmen towards the working people. We
must always remember, too, in discussing the social
changes that took place in England, that the absence
of violent dramatic effects, the limited and provincial
character of the contests of classes, were but necessary
consequences of the conditions of English life,
at a time when industrial and political disputes were
carried on by the local forces of every little town
independently, in a series of particular conflicts
fought out with varying success by groups of combatants
trained in small detachments for separate
service. It would be too much to imagine, because
we read of no open war of classes, no burning of
towns or insurrections quenched in blood, that the
whole industrial society of mediæval England moved
together in a harmonious and orderly progression,
each new group as it arrived being peacefully lifted
to its destined place in wealth and council, without
the jealousy of predecessors, or the bitter grudge of
after-comers. On the contrary all evidence goes to
show that the tenacity of Englishmen in holding to
power, and their stubbornness in insisting on freedom,
were as characteristic of the race in the fifteenth
as in the nineteenth century; that antagonism between
the man who asks and the man who pays a
wage, were very much the same as now; and that
class interests were if anything far more powerful.
If therefore we suppose the social and political
developement of the later middle-ages in this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was naturally brought about by the logical sequence
of economic developement, we must allow that
stern sequence to include then, as it would include
now, the passionate efforts of a strong people to
turn aside by their might the impending calamities
of fate, and to lay a violent grasp on her uncertain
benefactions.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GUILD MERCHANT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the conflicts of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries we see the town society rent into two
factions; and whether the contending groups call
themselves the Burghers and Commonalty, or “the
rich” and “the poor people of the city,” or the
Merchant Guild and the Crafts, or by any other
names, they seem practically to represent the same
broad sections of the community. In town quarrels
it is hard for us to draw any valid distinction
between groups of citizens and companies of craftsmen,
as though they were led by different passions;
for however numerous were the mere inhabitants who
must have lain outside the organization of the crafts,
usually every freeman was a member of some company,
and the whole voting population was thus
enrolled under the banners of the various trades.
The real line of cleavage on which we have to
concentrate attention is not the thin line which may
be drawn between the Town Council and the
Merchant Guild, the Commonalty and the Crafts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
but rather the broad chasm which breaks the whole
industrial society itself into two factions&mdash;on the
one side the merchant traders, on the other the
artificers and small retail dealers. Wherever the
lesser crafts who represented the middle classes of
the borough, and whose interests were more or less
identified with the cause of the commons and “poor
people of the city,” were forcing their claim to a
share in the counsels of the town; to which their
way was barred by a solid phalanx of hereditary
“magnates” and wealthy merchants who had abandoned
the meaner employments of trade and thrown
in their lot with the governing oligarchy of “the
rich,” and who fought in alliance with or under
cover of the burghers; there the revolt of the
commons against the Town Council becomes practically
a battle of the working crafts against the rule
of the mercantile fraternities&mdash;a battle which may be
fought at one time for the winning of civic privileges,
at another for industrial freedom.</p>

<p>If we ask how old this conflict was, and at what
time the peace of the town was first disturbed by
the antagonism of the greater commerce and the
lesser crafts, of the trader and the artificer, we must
go back for an answer to the very much earlier
period when commercial societies first became organized,
or at least to the twelfth century when the
Merchant Guild and the Crafts come prominently to
the front.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Unfortunately the history of the Guild
Merchant,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> from its obscure beginnings in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the Confessor, or of the Norman kings, down to
the time when its organization had spread all over
England, and its fraternities were to be found in
most of the trading boroughs, is still enveloped in
the darkness which covers the early records of our
towns, and problems await solution which involve the
whole developement of the Guild. We know that
from a remote period men had banded themselves
together in associations to secure protection and
monopoly of trade, and before the close of the
twelfth century the majority of trading towns had
each its “Merchant Guild” with rights guaranteed
by royal charter. First born into life in a society
where a merchant class such as we understand it
was unknown, we are told that the Guild may have
first consisted mainly of agriculturists busied in
tilling their common lands, and increasing their
herds of cows and sheep and pigs; and whose chief
anxiety was to sell the butter and honey and salt
meat and wool that remained over when they had
supplied their own wants, and to buy fish for the
fasting seasons, ploughs and spades for their fields
and the simplest furniture for their humble households.
But, in the opinion of its latest historian, from the
twelfth century artizans were freely admitted to its
society, and presently formed the majority of the
Guild<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>&mdash;each craftsman being a small trader on his
own account, buying his raw material, and selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
his manufactured goods at the stall he rented in the
market or on the folding shelf that he let down
to the street from the window of his little workroom.
With these were clergy and women who
busied themselves in trade;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> travelling dealers among
the townsfolk to whom exemptions from jurisdictions
outside the town and freedom from toll were important
(things which mattered little to the homekeeping
citizens); and strangers who brought their
wares to the town market,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> paid their entrance fee
and pledged themselves to bear henceforth their
share of the town taxes, though they were considered
free from all other charges that lay on the “downlying
and uprising and pot-boiling” householders.
It is therefore supposed that when the time came
for the Guild to emerge from its humble state of
private association, and rise into the dignity of an
official civic body, charged with the protection of
the trading interests of the borough,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> it formed a
really popular institution, which from its very nature
could never become entangled in a conflict with the
crafts&mdash;an organization of the whole community for
the control of trade by the common consent of the
people, which was in many respects peculiarly characteristic
of English life,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and which was the natural
product of an age of freedom before the people had
been trodden under foot of a despotic oligarchy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Theoretically subject to the authority of the town as
part of its regular administrative machinery,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> but
ruled over by its own officers, and exercising independent
jurisdiction through its voluntary tribunals
of arbitration, the Guild by virtue of its trade
monopoly,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> its powerful organization and discipline,
and the fact that the men who formed its governing
body were generally the same as those who sat on the
governing body of the borough, maintained a far
more independent position than any department of
town government to-day.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>But according to Dr. Gross the Gilda Mercatoria
was doomed to vanish away before the growth of
new industrial conditions. The first blow was struck
at its supremacy by the appearance early in the
twelfth century of crafts, which bought from the
king the right to exist as independent fraternities
during his pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> From this time the decline of
the Merchant Guild from its old estate kept pace with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the commercial revolution that caused its ruin. It
began to undergo its great change at the close of the
thirteenth century, and in the two following centuries
it may be said to have practically ceased to exist.
Broken up into a multitude of independent associations,
each of which carried on business for itself,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
deprived of all its old functions, it died because it
had no longer any adequate reason to live. Perhaps
it lingered on here and there in agricultural towns
where few or no craft guilds had been formed;<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> or in
ecclesiastical boroughs where its organization provided
the only rallying point for the community
in any struggle for freedom; but everywhere else its
machinery fell to pieces;<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and so completely did it
vanish away as a distinct body that the very name
only survived by taking to itself new meanings.
Sometimes the old Merchant Guild became indistinguishably
blended with the town and gave its
name to the whole community;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> though in another
place it perhaps handed over name and functions to
the narrow select governing body of the borough as
distinguished from the general community of citizens.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Elsewhere its title was in some vague way transferred
to the aggregate of the craft guilds.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> As a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
shadow of its former self, with nothing but the word
to mark its identity, the Merchant Guild might
survive as a simple social-religious fraternity;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> or
perhaps without conflict or bitterness it merely faded
away before the crafts, leaving not so much as a name
behind it.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> But however the implicit, unspoken
compact was carried out, by whatever means the Gilda
Mercatoria, obedient to a final destiny, effected its renunciation
of an inconvenient supremacy, there was
no possible occasion left for strife between Guild and
crafts,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and the suggestion of any such quarrel, or of
revolt on the part of the crafts against the superior
fraternity from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
must be looked on as a wanton “myth”.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Having
fulfilled its course the Merchant Guild took its doom
without noise or struggle, and entered decently into
the shades with a grave decorum before which jarring
sounds of contention were put to silence. It was at
a later time, when the old popular organization had
died, that the harmony of the commons was
destroyed by the coming in of a tyranny unknown
till then&mdash;the tyranny of a select and irresponsible
governing body which by its corrupt administration
stirred up a new spirit of dissension in the boroughs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this picture of the successive stages
of the guild history, from the free republican period
through which they are all apparently supposed to
have passed, down to their extinction or absorption
into a governing oligarchy, a whole borough community,
or a group of trades, has not been verified by
following out the continuous story of any single
guild. Moreover it would seem that the difficulty
of making any general statement about the
groups of traders who made the fortunes of the
English boroughs, is as great as the difficulty of
making a general statement as to the position and
grouping of a host of irregular troops in rapid
march over a tangled country. Amid the intense
activity and the transformation scenes of mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
life there is no exact definition which does not
prove false with a little lapse of time, a little change
of place; and theories of “natural tendency” are
but as traps set for the unwary. So far as the
Guild Merchant is concerned, there were probably
as many various exceptions to any general rule
as there were towns which contained a Guild. Let
but a generation pass away and the institution is
perhaps wholly changed; here it existed in some
special form; a few miles off it never existed at all;
in some boroughs it dominated the history of the
town, while in others it left but the bare echo of its
name behind.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> There may possibly have been towns
where at one time the Guild included within its
ranks the majority of the burghers, and perhaps
mainly consisted of craftsmen;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> but there were
evidently others where from the first it formed a
society far narrower and more restricted,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> or where it
rapidly tended to become a limited body of wealthy
citizens out of whose midst the craft guilds cannot
possibly have been developed; while occasionally it
may have happened that the craft guilds preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the Merchant Guild.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Even if the theory was
ostensibly maintained that craftsmen “were freely
enrolled among the members of the Guild Merchant”<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>&mdash;in
practice “gifts and entrance fees of a collation,
a bull, beer, and wine” could effectually keep out the
poorer sort, and allow the association<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> to develope
rapidly into an exclusive and comparatively aristocratic
society, which demanded from all save owners
of a house or burgage, or men entitled by direct
descent to belong to the fraternity, admission fees
big enough to guarantee the new comer’s fitness to
be of their fine company. The two ranks established
in the Andover Guild<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> as early as the thirteenth
century suggest how privilege might creep
in even among Guild members themselves; as the
merchants of Bristol teach us how it could be fought
for;<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> and there is no doubt that the policy of
each separate fraternity must have largely depended
on whether it adopted the custom of having its
officers chosen by consent of the whole community
of Guildsmen,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> or by a handful of electors of the
superior class.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Even if a considerable number of
burghers was admitted to trading privileges, it by no
means follows that they were allowed any voice in
the control of business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor are we less in the dark as to that “natural
process” by which the Guild is believed to have
passed to its resigned and painless end. The “transference
of authority from the ancient general Guild
Merchant to a number of distinct bodies and the
consequent disintegration and decay of the former,”<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
the weakening of its strength by the creation of new
crafts, the splitting up of its monopoly into fragments,
the annihilation of its original being to make place
for “the aggregate of the crafts,” the turning of the
Guild into a “simple social-religious fraternity”&mdash;a
kind of quiet haven of rest for wealthy merchants
who had given up the sweets of power and the
real government of trade in which their fortunes were
concerned, to busy themselves with dirges and masses
and chaplains, or even with a Corpus Christi procession&mdash;in
fact the whole “gradual and spontaneous”
movement in which lay the death of the primitive
fraternity is still enveloped in mystery. If craftsmen,
associated in their own peculiar guilds, yet remained in
the common Guild Merchant<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> which had once made
regulations for their trade, and in many cases still
did so,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> the instances (apart from cases where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Guild Merchant either was the municipal body, or
had simply handed over to it its name) are rare or
perhaps unknown in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries; nor can we easily follow the far more
complicated transformation said to have taken place
when the burgesses became the heirs of the general
body of guildsmen, by a double process which changed
the idea of citizenship from the conception of the
freeman holding a burgage tenure into the later idea
of a man holding the right to exercise a trade, and
which turned the governors of the guild into the
rulers of the town;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> so that by natural growth the
fraternity of the Guild Merchant, once wholly distinct
from the borough, became identical with it.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>It is very possible&mdash;indeed it is very probable if we
remember the thrift of the English people in politics,
their habit of fetching out the old machinery whenever
there seems a chance of making it useful; their
aversion to repairs or patches beyond what imperative
necessity demands; their indifference to new inventions
if the old wheels and cranks can still be induced
to turn&mdash;that we may learn something of the
working of the original Guild Merchant by watching
the doings of its successors in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. For whether the primitive Guild
had ceased to exist or no, something going by its
name and clothed in its form confronts us constantly
in the later times, soberly masquerading in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ancient habit which seems scarcely the worse for wear
or out of fashion for all the lapse of centuries; and
figuring before us as a robust survival, as an old
organization fitted out afresh for a pressing emergency,
or even as a new creation. We may watch in
Coventry such a Guild, which bears none of the
signs of decrepitude or symptoms of decay&mdash;a guild
which was in no sense a simple social-religious fraternity,
nor yet an ordinary craft guild; which was
far from being an aggregate of the trades; which
refused to the lesser crafts the right to combine,
and despotically governed their business in its own
interests; which was the municipal body of the
city and carried on its entire administration, but
never gave its name either to the community or to
the governing body; anti-democratic in its origin, in
its maturity, and in its old age; jealous of dominion;
incapable of making terms from behind its barricaded
doors with dissolution. Late as was its date, it has
features in its origin, its constitution, and its policy
far too like those of much earlier guilds, not to claim
our interest.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Born two or three hundred years out of due time
(for it was not till Queen Isabella became owner of
part of Coventry and interested in defending her
tenants’ rights against the Prior, that the city was
able to obtain the grant of a Gilda Mercatoria), it was
only in 1340 that the Merchant Guild of S. Mary’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
was founded<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>&mdash;an association apparently of dealers in
cloth, wool, and general merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Even then it
failed to secure license to mortmain, perhaps through
the resistance of the Prior, the lord of the soil; but
it is possible that the charter of incorporation for
the town, granted in 1344, was bought by the Guild,
and at least as early as 1347 and 1350 two of its
masters were mayors; while the Town Hall, where
the mayor and council met and where the chest
containing the town treasure and the charter were
kept, always bore the name of S. Mary’s Guild.</p>

<p>In the meantime two other societies had sprung
up&mdash;the guild of S. John Baptist<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> in 1342, and
the guild of S. Catherine in 1343&mdash;and the
three companies of S. Mary, S. John, and S.
Catherine united into one body between 1364 and
1369; and finally joined themselves to the Trinity
Guild, which had received license to mortmain in
1364, and gave its name to the whole association.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Considerable property was handed over in trust
for the combined societies to six of the chief
citizens of the town, most of whom had been
mayors several times, and one of whom had been
founder of S. John’s Guild. From this time the
history of the municipality is the history of its
leading guilds; and the further step taken in 1392,
when the four guilds were more formally united by
a patent of incorporation, and when fresh donations
of land were given to the whole body, was only a
fortifying of the position which it already held.</p>

<p>Though the name of the Merchant Guild was
sacrificed, doubtless for some sufficient reason, the
Trinity Guild was nothing more than an extension
of the primitive association under a new title.
The founders and donors and the early mayors are
usually classed together as “mercatores” in the
deeds, and the union seems to have represented the
wealthy upper class (drapers and mercers for the most
part, with a few leading members of other trades),<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
living in S. Michael’s parish, of which Queen Isabella
and her successors were the owners. Only one other
society was allowed to exist alongside of it,&mdash;the
fraternity of rich traders in Trinity parish (the
Prior’s half of the town), who were in 1348 licensed
to form the Corpus Christi Guild. Drawn from the
same rank, sharing the same interests, they cast in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
their lot with the merchants of the neighbouring
parish, contributed to the general town expenses,
and were admitted to a corresponding degree of
influence in the municipal government.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>For the Trinity and Corpus Christi Guilds were in
fact the governing body of the town. According
to the general custom the Master of the Corpus
Christi Guild was made Mayor in the second year
after his laying down that post, and two years after
his mayoralty he was set at the head of the Trinity
Guild.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> All important town officials were sworn
members of both the great companies; so were the
Leet Jury and the Twenty-four who elected the
mayor (these two bodies consisting of almost the
same individuals); and so were all the men who
might be summoned on the Mayor’s Council to aid
the Twenty-four. By this simple device, the fear of
an alien party being formed in the Council was once
for all banished; for if the Corpus Christi Guild held
its elections in the Bishop’s palace<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> and had its centre
in Trinity Church on the Prior’s land,&mdash;if its members
included the Prior and his bailiff, the vicar, and
strangers, some of them of great estate, from near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and far<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>&mdash;all dangerous elements were made harmless
by the order that none of its members should
meddle with town affairs unless he had been first
approved and accepted by the Trinity Guild. The
Corpus Christi fraternity in fact was admitted to its
position by a sort of cautious sufferance, and all real
power lay with the Guild of the Trinity. Its master
was a Justice of the Peace, and therefore took a leading
part in all the most important business of the courts;
he was first on the list of the Twenty-four who
elected the mayor and who also sat at the Leet Court.
Invariably he was one of the five men chosen by the
mayor to keep the keys of the common chest&mdash;being,
in fact, in matters of finance supreme; for at the end
of the mayor’s year of office it was to the master that
he delivered up his accounts and his balance “and is
quit”; and the Guild was not only charged with the
payment of salaries to public officials&mdash;the recorder,
the grammar-school master, the priests in the Lady
Chapel of S. Michael’s, and the warden and priests at
Bablake&mdash;but as early as 1384 it was ordered by the
Leet to pay yearly the ferm to the Prior, in return for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
which a certain part of the common lands was made
over into its possession. The keeping of Bablake Gate
was committed to it; and it was given possession of
the Drapery Hall, which was used as the cloth mart
under the control of the municipality.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>But this great society, known on the one side as
the Trinity Guild, on the other as the Town Corporation,
owed in neither aspect anything whatever to
popular election,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> and made no pretence at government
according to the will of the people.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> From the very
moment of the first union of the fraternities the story
of revolt among the 7,000 workers who thronged the
streets of Coventry begins, and is repeated from
generation to generation for the next hundred and
fifty years. Incessant riots declared the discontent of
the commons at the light loaves sold under mayors
who neglected to keep the assize of bread, at false
measures allowed for selling corn, at the encroachments
on common lands by chamberlains and councillors,
at the government of trade by the drapers
and mercers enrolled in the two great guilds of the
city, while weavers, shearmen, fullers, and tailors,
lying for the most part outside these guilds, had little
hope of ever rising to municipal power.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The crafts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in fact, were kept in uncompromising subjection. When
the fullers and tailors tried to set up a fraternity,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
the ruling guilds obtained a charter in 1407 which
forbade the creation of any other society than their
own. They had this grant confirmed in 1414; and
the next year they appealed to Parliament against
the dyers<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> who endeavoured to form a confederation
of cloth-makers and wool-sellers. S. George’s
Guild&mdash;a union of the “young men, serving men
of the tailors and other artificers, and labourers
working by the day called journeymen,” who defiantly
gathered in S. George’s Chapel and elected “masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and clerks and other officials to fulfil their youthful
and insolent desires,” and “abet each other in their
quarrels”&mdash;was put down because it was “to the ruin
and destruction of the Guilds of Holy Trinity and
Corpus Christi and disturbance of all the community.”<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
Though the fullers and tailors once more obtained
license in 1438 to hold property, their union was
broken up in the next ten years;<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and the
persistence of the dyers in clinging to their illegal
combinations was opposed in 1475 by an ordinance
that unlawful writings and oaths made by dyers
and other crafts were to be “void, quashed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
annulled,” and members of the craft should not
be sued for not observing these illegal ordinances.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
Circuitous attempts to win independence by informally
setting up voluntary tribunals where the members
of the trade assembled to settle disputes, were met
by the order that no masters of crafts should sue
any of their craft in any kind of suit in special courts
until the mayor have heard the matter and licensed
the suit; on the plea that “discord falls out continually
because masters of crafts sue in special courts
divers people of their crafts, affirming they have
broken their oaths made in breaking divers rules,
which rules are ofttimes unreasonable, and the punishment
of the said masters excessive, which, if it continue,
by likelihood will cause much people to void
out of this city.”<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> With regard to customs on wool, or
the conditions of sale for the coarse cloth of the people,
or the regulations for apprentices, the merchants
passed laws which drove the commons to impotent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
fury;<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and the wild dreams of revolution that passed
from street to street for the century after John Ball
found his hiding-place in the lanes of Coventry, are
told in the rhymes nailed by the people on the
church door side by side with the official announcements,
where we hear their passionate outcry for the
freedom of the good old days of Godiva, and threats
of a time when the “littel small been” and “wappys”
should “also sting”;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> or in the teaching of the
leader of the populace that the city would have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
peace till three or four of the churls that ruled them
had their heads stricken off.</p>

<p>But if the Trinity Guild was in this complete sense
the governing body of the town&mdash;if its legislation
was at once so characteristic and so irresistible&mdash;by
what strange access of modesty was it restrained from
taking to itself the glory, and letting its name blot
out all others on the city roll?<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Such renunciation,
we can scarcely doubt, whether in Coventry or
in other places where the problem presents itself, was
more likely to spring from the “grace of guile” than
from modesty. From the point of view of worldly
wisdom, indeed, the arguments for a diplomatic self-effacement
were overwhelming; for it was easy to
discern the dangers to its hoarded treasure which a
guild must incur from the moment when in the eyes
of the law or of its officers it became confounded with
the municipality. Safety lay in silence, and if the
name of the guild lingered in the Guildhall, it did
not pass the precincts; while by a wise precaution
the actual mayor of the borough was never
allowed to be the same person as the actual
master of the guild,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> lest the higher authorities
should in some emergency make an easy confusion
between the keys with which he opened the
treasure-box of the community, and those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
unlocked the coffers of the guild.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> If there were
any doubt before 1392<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> about the meaning of thus
carefully preserving the double aspect of the fraternity,
there seems but little after it. For in that year when
the Coventry Guild got its new formal patent and its
increased income, it was only following a somewhat
common fashion of the day.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> In 1392 the bailiffs and
commonalty of Birmingham obtained leave to have
their Guild of the Holy Cross&mdash;“a guild and brotherhood
of bretheren and sisteren among themselves in
that town ... and men and women well disposed
in other towns and in the neighbourhood”&mdash;which
might hold lands in mortmain, and which was intimately
connected with the governing body of the
town. The Town Hall or Guild Hall was built by it,
and charities were distributed “according to the ordering
and will of the bailiffs and commonalty”; and it
“kept in good reparacioune two great stone bridges
and divers foul and dangerous highways, the charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
whereof the town of itself is not able to maintain.”<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
In the same year, 1392, “the seneschalls of the Guild
Merchant of Bridgewater and of the community of
the same town” obtained a grant to assign certain
lands in mortmain,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and an indenture which probably
belongs to the beginning of the reign of Edward the
First<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> proves that there was a close relation of this
guild on one side to the fraternity of S. Mary or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the Holy Cross, and on the other to the corporation
of the town. The brotherhood of the Holy Cross at
Abingdon, which was established under Richard the
Second, seems to have been practically the governing
body of the borough, owned most of the landed property
in the town in the fifteenth century, and spent
money liberally in the building of churches and the
market cross.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Such guilds as these seem to have been the quick
retort of the towns to the Act of 1391, which for the
first time extended to cities and boroughs the Statute
of Mortmain passed in 1279, and placed them in a
position where they could thenceforth boast of no
advantage over religious corporations, and like them
had to buy leave to hold property. But it seemed
beyond the wit of man to put English traders into
a difficulty which was not by their very touch
turned into a new opportunity for gain. If right
to hold corporate property must now be bought,
whatever claimant appeared, then why should it
not be bought by a private society of merchants,
sheltered under the Holy Cross or the Trinity,
rather than by the town community or the burgesses?
On the one hand the leading citizens, the
intelligent and prosperous men of the town, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
secured an indestructible claim to guide its fortunes
aright; on the other hand the town funds were by the
same measure garnered once for all in a safe hiding-place&mdash;in
other words, if troublesome officers from the
exchequer should come with demands for inconvenient
rent or forfeitures, they were met by the fact that
the men of the town <i>had</i> nothing, while the men of
the guild <i>owed</i> nothing. The system seems to have
worked as effectively as the British constitution itself.
We know that the Coventry Guild, besides the
property it already held, had taken over yet
more at its incorporation in 1392. But in 1468,
Coventry being then the fourth city in the kingdom,
it was £800 in arrears for its ferm; and since
the goods of “the mayor and men of Coventry”
only amounted to 106<i>s.</i>, and since the said
“mayor and men” had no other goods or lands
within the bailiwick that could be taken into the
king’s hands, no further payment was then made.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> If
we remember the wealth of the Trinity and Corpus
Christi Guilds, the fact that they probably held the
main portion of the common property,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> and their
close connexion with the city government,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> it is plain
that the town was doing very good business in withdrawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
its funds from the reach of the king’s
officers; and that the traders had adequately realized
their purpose in setting up in their Townhall one
of those familiar companies which was admitted
at home to be in effect the corporation, but which
was officially known at Westminster only as a
“simple” social-religious fraternity that yearly carried
S. George and his Dragon or some other poetic
emblem through the streets with solemn festival, or
kept great tendrilles of wax burning before the
Holy Cross in the parish church.</p>

<p>That the Trinity society of Coventry was not the
last of these astute fraternities of traders we know;<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
that it was not the first we may safely believe.
Indeed, it might well have been modelled on the
fraternity of the Trinity at Lynn<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>&mdash;an older company
by a hundred and fifty years, whose members
would at no time have found any trouble in discussing
the secrets of their policy with the merchants of
Coventry. It may be that the texture of society was
never so simple or so uniform as historians have believed,
that the humble mediæval merchant loomed
big in the eyes of his yet humbler fellow-citizens,
and that in many a trading town the Guild Merchant
was the monument of the successful capitalists of
the village, and of a triumph so complete that the
petty details of its progress fell out of memory.
How many typical forms the early guild may have
taken from town to town, as it squeezed its way
with or without a welcome into communities of every
shape and consistence, we have not yet materials to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
say; nor do we yet know by what varieties of compact
it may have become the indispensable minister
or the master of the municipal authority; or what was
its common relation to the lesser forms of trade. It
is indeed conceivable that later research may show us
that in many cases the subjection of the crafts to the
town&mdash;a subjection so astonishing in the silence, the
calm, the rapidity with which it is affected&mdash;was
carried out by the indissoluble union of guild and
corporation. Organized in days when the way to
wealth lay in the buying and selling of raw material,
and in consequence by its constitution destitute of
powers to follow the artizan into his workroom and
meddle with his tools and the stuff of his trade, the
Guild Merchant must very early have seen its officers
falling behind the officers of the town before whom all
bars and doors were thrown open; but if, suiting their
policy to the necessities of the situation, seneschals and
scavins of the Guild preserved their power by becoming
bailiffs and councillors of the borough, not by laying
down their authority before the wardens of the cobblers
or the tailors, or even by taking them into its councils;
such a guild might make its end neither by resigning
to the crafts its cherished prerogatives nor by a
spontaneous death, but by a consecrated alliance, in
which it only seemed to merge its identity in the
borough corporation, while in reality it secured the
preservation of its ancient name and guaranteed the
traditions and authority of its order. As in
Coventry, the force which had first served to overthrow
the mastery of the lord of the soil might be
employed later to enforce its own despotism over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
subject people; and the question whether it used an
old or a new name was a matter of little consequence
to the inferior and dependent class. In either case
the control of the town rested in the hands of an
oligarchy of the richer sort of traders, who by
combination were able to exact from the mass of
the working people an unlimited submission, and
practically held at their mercy the fortunes of the
free commons of the city.</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">NOTE A.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>The satisfactory working of the system may be inferred from
its continued use in the next century. Plymouth may serve as
an illustration. Among the three little fishing hamlets, the
Augustinian Priors’ Sutton or South Town at the mouth of the
Plym, and two King’s Suttons which had been granted out to
noble families, the first stirrings of independent life seem to have
begun about 1282, when the Sutton people, wanting to be free
burgesses and to have their fair and market, begged for a piece of
waste ground near the port, five perches long and one broad, and
a piece of land “in the withdrawal of the sea” six acres big,
where the King’s bailiff held his court in a certain house, and
where every fishing boat coming to dry nets or sails paid toll to
the King. They set up a stone cross and a stall for their market;
in 1311 they made a final agreement with the Prior, and then or
very soon after began yearly to elect a “Præpositus, or Custos
Ville de Sutton Priors, which did then rule and govern under the
King.” (In the time of Edward the Third he was called mayor;
Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 274-5, 279, see also 297.) In 1411 the townsmen
petition that they may yearly elect a mayor and be incorporated
so as to be able to buy tenements without royal license (Gross,
i. 94); but apparently it was not till 1440 that they really gained
their wish by the efforts of a rich merchant of Bristol, Richard
Trenode, who traded with Plymouth, and of his sister Thomasine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
widow of a Plymouth citizen; who at great cost and labour won
for the group of hamlets their final union into the free borough
of Plymouth “with one Mayor and one perpetual Commonalty”;
for which the town in gratitude bound itself in a sum of £200 to
maintain a chaplain in the parish church of S. Andrew to pray
daily for their souls.</p>

<p>The important point is, however, that it was in this year, 1440,
that the Plymouth Guild Merchant was either first established, or
formally confirmed and given a definite position. (Gross, i. 15.)
On one side a religious guild, on the other it was the governing
body of the town, very jealous of its monopoly of power, as we see
from the order of 1472, that every man made a freeman should be
either a whole or a half-brother in Our Lady and S. George’s
Guild, a whole brother paying 12<i>d.</i> yearly, and a half-brother 6<i>d.</i>;
and that if any of the commons was made one of the Twenty-four
he must pay 8<i>d.</i> yearly to the Guild, while if one of the Twenty-four
was made one of the Twelve he must pay 1<i>s.</i> (Hist. MSS.
Com. ix. 272.) Like the Guild at Coventry of a century earlier
the fraternity seems to have been at first an organization
of the more enterprising inhabitants to secure the liberties promised
by charter, to make a stand against any aggressions of the
Earl of Devon, and to rid themselves of some of their obligations
to the Prior, on the plea of a convenient poverty, and a subtle
appeal to the new King Edward the Fourth to revise arrangements
made by Henry the Sixth “late in deed and not of right King of
England.” (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 272.) The ancient Guild of
Totnes, known as the “Guild of the Commonalty” as late as
1333, survived in full power in 1449, when it was ordered that
no one shall carry the mace before the mayor save a member of
the Merchant Guild (Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 344-5).</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWN DEMOCRACY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to a theory which is commonly accepted
the English borough in its first condition, and
probably during a considerable part of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, did actually realize the ideal
of a true democratic society; the spirit of popular
liberty penetrated the whole community, pervading
the council and assembly of the town, the leet court,
the guild merchant, the companies of artizans; and
under the favouring influences of equality and fraternity
government was guided by common consent of
the burgesses, by whom elections were conducted and
administration controlled. Elsewhere it is known
that the early communes, however strong their
protest against the tyranny of alien despots, were
within their own circle far from democratic in temper
or practice; but it has been believed that in England,
possibly by virtue of her people’s passionate instinct
for liberty, town societies wore a more popular character
and expressed a loftier freedom. If this theory
be exact, however, the reign of the democracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
was brief, and the later history of the towns from
the fourteenth century onwards is the tale of a swift
decline from the enjoyment of primitive liberty into
impotent subjection to the rule of a narrow and
selfish oligarchy, the usurpers of the people’s rights.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
The hypothesis of a constant degradation of municipal
liberty from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries
becomes invested with extraordinary interest,
since all our judgments of the part that England
has played in the history of free government must
be coloured and determined by the ideas we accept
as to the kind of civil freedom in which her people
have really believed, the classes who have held
to that faith, and the means by which they have
pursued it. In the absence of some strong compulsion,
forcing men to yield obedience to a “select”
body, we question what outward influences or what
inward apathy could have led the boroughs, at the
moment when wealth and prosperity crowned their
vast activity, thus unanimously to betray the privileges
of their constitution and to deny their early
faith; for in view of the whole drift of English
history, and remembering how great a part the
men of the towns played at this time in English
life, it may well seem inconceivable that the mental
and political emancipation of the sixteenth century
should have been attained by a people who in the
conduct of their own local affairs had already universally
abandoned a noble tradition of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
rights and idly consented to the tyranny of a mere
plutocracy.</p>

<p>To find an example of the primitive form of
municipal institutions, and how they were at the
outset understood by the people, we naturally turn
to the well-known story of Ipswich. On June 29,
1200, “the whole community of the borough” elected
the two bailiffs by whom it was to be governed, and
four coroners, whose business it was to keep the pleas
of the crown and see that the bailiffs treat rich and
poor justly; and on the same day by common counsel
of the town it was ordered that there should be
“twelve sworn capital portmen, just as there are in
other boroughs in England, who are to have full
power to govern and uphold the said borough with
all its liberties, to render the judgments of the town,
and to ordain and do all things necessary for the
maintenance of its honour.” From this moment
“the community” as it were unclothed itself of
power to lay it on the shoulders of the bailiffs and
coroners, who thereupon proceeded to act with all the
authority with which they had been endued. They
first appointed four approved and lawful men of each
parish, who in their turn elected the twelve portmen.
This being done, bailiffs, coroners, and portmen met&mdash;a
little company of twelve, since bailiffs and coroners
had all been appointed capital portmen too&mdash;to make
ordinances about the collection of customs and the
police officers by whom their decrees were to be
carried out. In due time the whole community was
called together to give their assent and consent to
these ordinances; and they once more assembled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
bestow a portion of their common land on the
portmen in return for their labour in the common
service, and to agree that all the laws and free
customs of the town should be entered in a doomsday
roll to be kept by the bailiffs.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Here then we have the simplest form of early
government&mdash;a council of twelve “worthy and
sufficient men” to assist the mayor or bailiffs in the
administration of the town, controlled by a <i>referendum</i>
to the general body of burghers. The doors of
the common house or the church where the councillors
met stood open to all the freemen of the borough
who might attend to hear discussions, even in cases
where they were not allowed to join in them.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> And
in the original idea of the free borough every public
act was legally supposed to require the whole consent
of the community from which theoretically at least
all power was ultimately derived; so that whether a
new distribution of the common fields was made, or
soldiers were called out and a settlement agreed upon
as to their payment, or guns bought or hired for the
common house or the church tower; whether an
inquiry was ordained about the “livelihood” of the
inhabitants and the taxes to be imposed on them, or
a new law proposed, or new freemen admitted to the
city liberties, or municipal officers elected, it was
officially assumed that the unanimous assent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
whole people had been given in their common
assembly.</p>

<p>The privileges of the common assembly are perhaps
best defined in the customs of Hereford, drawn up in
1383, but which doubtless embody customs of older
times. There we learn that at the great meetings
held at Michaelmas and Easter, to which the whole
people were gathered for view of frankpledge (in
other words at the court leet), “the pleas of the
court being finished, the bailiff and steward, on
the behalf of our lord the king and the commonalty,
may command that all those which are not of the
liberty should go out of the house and depart from
the court; and then the bailiff and steward may take
notice if there are any secrets or business which may
concern the state of the city or the citizens thereof,
and let them proceed therein as they ought to do.”<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
To these assemblies, according to the custom of
Hereford, the people ought to come, and if there was
anyone “which will complain of any trespasses
committed, or any other thing touching the state of
the city or themselves, they ought to speak the truth
upon their own peril, not bringing with them any
stranger ... because we do not use that strangers
shall come and implead amongst us and know the
secrets of the court for divers dangers that thereby
may ensue.”<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> In case of necessity the bailiff “by all
kinds of rigour” might compel the discreeter citizens
to come to the court and take their due part in its
labours; and in Sandwich we know that if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
burgesses summoned by bell or horn failed to appear,
the “rigour” of the mayor might go as far as the
sending of a serjeant to shut up all shops and
work-rooms in the town, and thus compel the burghers’
attention to public instead of private business.</p>

<p>In the general assembly there was always present
the most conspicuous, if the most unwieldy, symbol
of the authority of the people, and of the supreme
power which was theirs, not only by law, but by an
ancient customary right which to the last remained
independent of statute or charter. It is true that
the common gathering of the people&mdash;without executive
authority, without power to initiate laws,
called together merely to give or refuse assent to the
deeds of the government&mdash;would in itself have given
the democracy very little hold on the town magistrates
in the exercise of their office. The theory of
the constitution, however, was that those who were
mainly charged with making and administering the
laws should be yearly chosen for their work by the
people whom they were called to govern. The
mayor who stood at the head of the administration
was, according to the common formula which pointed
back to the fundamental right and first intention
of the institution, elected “by assent and consent
of the whole community of the town,” and “in
the place from of old accustomed;”<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and as each
community was allowed to decide for itself how
this “assent and consent” should be ascertained,
there were perhaps towns where the practice followed
the theory. Thus in Sandwich the unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
consent of the whole town was given by public vote in
a general assembly. On the first Monday in December
at one o’clock of the day, the town serjeant sounded
the common horn, and made his cry at the fourteen
accustomed places, “Every man of twelve years or
more go to St. Clement’s Church; there our commonalty
hath need. Haste, haste!”; and when the
people had gathered in the church, having first
ordered the mayor to withdraw, they named him and
three other natives of the town to be “put in
election,” one of whom was then appointed by the
whole assembly voting after their degree, jurats first
and freemen afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>This practice was no doubt rare, but the theory
that the mayor was the elected servant of the whole
people, enshrined in the town book of customs, in
ordinance and statute, never died out of the common
speech and belief of the people. “We must obey our
chief bailiff as one presenting the person of the king,”
the burghers of Hereford say deferentially, and proceed
to make him swear on assuming office “that he
shall do all things belonging to his office by the
counsel of his faithful citizens”; and to order that if
he refused to answer complaints he should be proceeded
against as for perjury; that if his accounts
were not faithfully rendered all his goods should be
seized; and that if “he shall be dishonest or proclaimed
or suspected or convicted of any crime, he
shall forthwith be put out of his place.”<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> And as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
mayor was the people’s servant, so in theory at least
his election was supposed to be of their pure free-will.
“From this time forth,” say the inhabitants of
Wycombe in 1505, “no burgess nor foreigner make
no labour, nor desire no man to speak before the
day of election of the mayor for no singular desire,
but every man to show their voices at their own mind,
without trouble or unreasonable doing there in the
time of their election.”<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The chosen head of the people was thus to the
popular sentiment the type and symbol of their freedom,
and a Bristol chronicler tells us how, the mayor
being accused by an enemy of the king’s household,
the townspeople followed after him as he was led to
prison, lamenting and weeping “as sons for their
natural father.”<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> He was assisted by councillors
also chosen to uphold the liberties of the borough;
and the frequent use of elected juries in public
business served still further to maintain the ancient
tradition of rights vested in the people. In the
manor courts of the country the jury made its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
way slowly and with difficulty, but in the town
courts it seems to have taken complete hold very
early, and to have been worked constantly and
elaborately.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The system was applied to all manner
of local business. Not only did the Leet jury in
some towns, as in Nottingham and Andover, occupy
itself with a vast range of affairs connected with
government and legislation; but it was a universal
custom to appoint representatives of the community
for any special purpose. Everywhere we have
glimpses of bodies of jurors chosen to elect officers,
to assess taxes, to make statements as to a broken
bridge, to hold discussions about tallages or about
disputed boundaries<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>&mdash;transient apparitions supposed,
when their work is done, to dissolve into their constituent
householders, and which appear and vanish
again as the centuries pass, till the burghers, recognizing
in them an admirable machinery for larger uses,
fix or seek to fix them into permanent existence as
town councils. To a people inheriting the high and
inalienable prerogatives of a chartered borough, with
the right of free meeting and free speech in their
general assembly, presided over by a “natural father”
of their own choosing, the jury system might seem
to afford the final safeguard of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the ideal of a self-governing community
in early times&mdash;an ideal to which in later ages men
looked back wistfully, as summing up the faith and
practice of a golden age. Whenever the mayor was
summoned to take his oath to the people on “the
Black Book” of the city, instead of the Gospels;<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
whenever according to custom the ancient ordinances
of the town were yearly read before the people
gathered together, the ideal of a noble liberty was
proclaimed anew. The boast that the borough’s rights
were founded and grounded upon franchises, liberties,
and free ancient customs, and not upon common law,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
remained a living faith; and a tradition of independence
sanctioned and enjoined by authority was handed
down from generation to generation, by men who believed
themselves born into a birthright of freedom
for which they need plead neither the law of nature
nor the law of Rome,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> since it was the honest handicraft
of English kings and English lawyers, and paid
for in hard cash out of their own grandfathers’ pockets.</p>

<p>But behind law and charter there lay always the
great appeal to immemorial custom. In that dim
time of which no memory is, a power yet more
venerable and imposing than law itself had been the
keeper of popular liberties; and to the last we may
perhaps trace the obscure record of a double origin
of rights in the two words by which the borough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
expressed its corporate existence&mdash;the “Citizens”
or “Burgesses,” and the “Commonalty” or “Community.”
By the common explanation of these terms
they are supposed originally to have borne exactly
the same meaning, and alike served to express the
general body of freemen in the borough; but
presently to have diverged in sense as the more
important “citizens” gradually absorbed the management
of public business, and appropriated to
themselves the name of honour, while the lower
classes were massed together as “the communitas,”
so that this word at last came to be little more than
a contemptuous nick-name given to the mob in the
later days of oligarchic rule. In the town records,
however, we find these two words used from first
to last in a precise and formal manner which is most
characteristic of the Middle Ages; each one having
its own character and meaning, and neither of them
invading the place of the other. As far back as the
thirteenth century “the Burgesses” already appear
as distinct from the commons at large, and use their
title with an official and technical significance attached
to the phraze which gives it a special value.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
The use of the word in charters and deeds seems
then to denote the corporate body of citizens who
had been legally endowed with certain privileges,
whose association had been created by charter and
was dissolved if the borough lost its franchise; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
who in a vast mass of business, and especially in
relations of the borough to the crown, were represented
by the official body of the town which acted
in their name, and especially assumed the title of
“the Burgesses.”</p>

<p>But behind this corporate body lies the “communitas”&mdash;a
term which has a far earlier origin and
a far deeper meaning. Whatever may be the base
use of the word which has crept into chronicles and
common talk, in municipal deeds and ordinances it
is a name of dignity and honour&mdash;an ancient title of
nobility. It carries the mind far back to the primitive
society of householders in the ville, bound by mutual
ties and protected by customary rights, which had
preceded the free borough, and by its discipline had
created the advanced type of commonwealth which
is discovered to us in Ipswich at the inauguration of
its new career as a chartered town. We feel the
story of new beginnings such as this to be the consummation
of a long history; and even under the
corporate life of the citizens recognized by law we
may sometimes detect the persistent survival of the
ancient community, which still emerges in the half
light with its consecrated title, and the remnants of
its old functions ever clinging to its shadowy form.
For it seems that in municipal records the “community”
or “commune” possibly appears as something
which existed before the corporation in time,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which might have its common seal separate from
the mayor’s seal,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> which held property and exercised
certain powers, and independent as it was of all
charters, survived all loss of franchises conferred by
royal grant alone. We seem to find it asserting its
existence when the borough had been dismembered,
and there was no longer any place for “the citizens.”
It sends its appeals to the King over the heads of
the official caste; when an intermunicipal treaty has
to be drawn up the “communitas” usually appears
as the contracting body, whose members are bound
together in mutual responsibility; it claimed to hold
common property of the borough under its own name
and apparently by some other title than the burgesses;
and by its very existence it maintained to
the last the tradition of an ancient free community
reaching back to a time of which no memory was, and
endowed with prerogatives on which neither mayor
nor council dared to lay their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The privileges of the early community were no
doubt quickly merged in the more liberal rights
which were made sure to the borough by its charter;
but there was one department, the management of
their common lands, in which the existence of a
separate power seems to exhibit itself beyond all
doubt.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Never did the commonalty abandon their
right of control over the public estate. The division
of strips of arable ground, the apportionment of
pastures and closes, the letting of stalls or fields, the
gathering in of rents for burgages or common property
let on lease, these were things done by the act
and in the name of the whole community, without
any mention of “council” or “citizens”; and in
one borough after another any tampering with the
public estate by the governing class drove the whole
body of inhabitants into the streets threatening revolution.
In their claim to “have knowledge from
year to year how the common ground is occupied and
by whom, and if that it be not rented the commons to
seize it into their hands, to that end that they may be
remembered of their right, and to have profit and avail
thereof” ... and “to know verily what their rent
cometh to,”<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> the freemen of the fifteenth century
carried on a tradition known in the boroughs two
hundred years before, and in many instances their
tenacious grip on the town lands was evidently one of
the most important factors in the shaping of town
politics.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>From the very beginning of municipal records,
therefore, we find the town living as it were a double
life&mdash;the one buttressed on either side by law and
charter&mdash;the other sending roots deep down into the
past, and drawing from primitive custom and tradition
a sustenance which “Westminster law”<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> could
neither give nor take away; the one regularly expressed
in the stately proceedings of “the Citizens”&mdash;the
other finding a fitful and incoherent, but no
less distinctive utterance in the doings of “the commonalty;”
and the two, intimately allied and constantly
hostile, persisting side by side through
centuries of strained but honourable union. With
these immemorial traditions of franchises, liberties,
and free ancient customs, it followed that when
burghers set up any plea for liberties old or new
they imported no revolutionary note into their
demands. It is hard to tell from what source they
drew their faith in a freedom which they confessed
to have been lost, which indeed neither they nor
their fathers had known; but it seems that the conviction
never failed of an ancient type and pattern
of liberty which had been proved once for all by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
remote ancestors of the heroic age. Townsmen professed
to claim nothing more than such privileges as
were “according to our Red Book as we do think”;
or that had been bestowed by a charter of the House
of Alfred which had once compassed them about with
liberty, though it was now, alas, <i>casualiter amissa</i>;
or that dated back to the time when the grace of the
Lady Godiva had broken the bonds of slavery. Just
as Englishmen under the rule of the foreign kings
looked back with desire to the good laws of the Confessor,
so the burghers had their fiction, too, of the
joy of their first estate as by law established, and
turned over the rolls of their treasure chest and
bought copies of Magna Charta, to discover anew the
light of privilege that had once irradiated the whole
commonalty. We have seen in the case of Exeter
how this essential faith of the people survived, as it
had preceded, their study of historical documents. As
the spirit of independence and discussion awoke, the
conflict that was presently to be waged in the domain
of religion was oddly foreshadowed in the realm of
municipal politics; when the common folk demanded
that they should be allowed to return to the written
law in its primitive and unadulterated purity; while
the guardians of established order, aldermen and
councillors and great people of “the clothing,”&mdash;resting
on the theory of a living tradition and its
secular “developement,”&mdash;appealed with no less
confidence and insistence to the majesty of law as it
appeared when interpreted by the custom of generations
and expounded by the scarlet-robed officials
who surrounded the mayor.</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">NOTE A.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Mr. Maitland (Law Quarterly, January, 1893) gives a most
interesting account of the customs of holding and dividing lands
in various boroughs. On the whole he doubts whether the
holding of land by burgesses subject to communal regulations is
generally a very ancient arrangement. There seems, however,
to be evidence for the antiquity of the holding of common
property by the community; and it may be possible further to
discover the existence of a permanent distinction between the
property thus held by the community for the common use, and
that held by the corporation for certain special purposes, such as
payment of ferm, taxes, public servants, and the like&mdash;a distinction
which rests on the different function which I have suggested
in the case of those bodies.</p>

<p>The community of Ipswich apparently possessed land before
1200. (Gross, ii. 122, cap. xviii. 115.) For its common lands see
also Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 234-7, 246. Lands were held by
Wycombe (Ibid. v. 556-7). In Morpeth the “burgesses and
community” make grants of land in the thirteenth century.
(Ibid. vi. 527.) Andover in 1314 owned land managed by
the community. (Gross, ii. 307, 326, 330.) Oxford (Boase,
47) and Chester might also be cited. Also Hythe (Hist. MSS.
Com. iv. i. 432, 433), and Worcester (English Guilds, 386) and
Preston (Preston Guild Records, xxiv.). The Nottingham
Records mention the “land of the community” (ii. 269. See
also 304-6). A grant of six acres of mosses was given to
Liverpool in 1309 (Picton’s Municipal Records, i. 8, 12. For
the results of holding this property see 11). Birmingham held
land and rights of common (Survey of the Borough and Manor,
xiv. 74, 102).</p>

<p>Romney held the Salt Marsh, the Gorse, the Horseho, and the
Harpe pastures, the old bed of the Rother, the forelands and
saltpits and warrens and gardens and marshlands, “the land of
the commonalty” (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 536, 537, 539, 540-3).</p>

<p>Lydd (Ibid. v. 525, 531-2) seems to have held marshland
common on the Ripe for at least four hundred sheep, and
the boroughs of Dengemarsh and Orwellstow. Its ownership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of the shore as against the claims of the crown was proved in the
time of Elizabeth by evidence from “the face and vieu of the
antienty of the town and church, and buryall of men cross-legged
and such like monuments.” A seal given to the community
by the archbishop at the beginning of their incorporation
“long before the Conquest,” as rumour said, was used (as distinguished
from the bailiff’s seal) as late as Elizabeth’s time for the
selling or letting of lands by the town. (Ibid. v. 530-2.) The
cases of Lydd and Morpeth illustrate the way in which the lord
of a borough granted it the possession of land along with grants
of local government and independence.</p>

<p>Colchester had 500 acres of Lammas lands besides Mile End
Heath, etc. (Cutts’ Colchester, 142-4); and meadow still divided
by boundary stones into strips. (Ibid. 67-8. See also for 1322
p. 142.)</p>

<p>Coventry owned common lands in the fourteenth century, of
which there is no suggestion that they were newly acquired,
and which belonged to the community and not to the corporation,
and were distinct from lands or property acquired under the
statute of mortmain and used for the payment of town officers,
etc.</p>

<p>There were boroughs whose disputes about their property dated
from the very beginning of their corporate existence. Southampton
was already quarrelling about its common in the thirteenth
century; and the Norwich citizens were engaged in a lawsuit in
1205 as to their rights of pasture on land for which rent was due
to the Prior, but which the Prior could not legally either enclose
or cultivate without a grant from the city. (Norwich Town Close
Evidences, 4, 5. For the common lands see ibid. pp. 52-64.)</p>

<p>In some instances the burghers apparently did not profess to
own the soil but only to hold an exclusive right to its use; and
the furious excitement of the Norwich citizens (see p. 392) about
a tribute of 4<i>s.</i> yearly to the Prior for a certain meadow proves
how very thin the boundary line between possession and use might
become.</p>

<p>The main evidence as to the possession of lands lies in the town
archives and not in public records. It is a question for lawyers
why disputes concerning them apparently were not brought
before the judges of the King’s Bench, but seem to have been
settled at home by fighting or by arbitration. Possibly because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the “communitas” had no power to sue in the law courts as a
legal person. In any case it must have had all kinds of dangers to
fear&mdash;the danger of having local customary law overridden by
Westminster law, the danger of advertising the amount of
their possessions, and a danger which is constantly present in
town records, of encroachments under one pretence or another
by the corporation or members of it, and the fear of which,
in days when “the law is ended as a man is friended,” would
give reason enough for keeping out of the courts.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWN OLIGARCHY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident that if the towns had been called on
for a confession of faith, the declaration of a pure and
unadulterated freedom would have been in every
mouth. There remains the question of how far it was
found possible to carry that faith into the common
practice of daily life.</p>

<p>We have seen how freedom was enthroned at
Ipswich before the whole community of townsmen,
who with outstretched hands and loud unanimous
voice swore before heaven to maintain the liberties
of the new republic. If, however, we glance
again at Ipswich when it next comes clearly into
view, a century after it had obtained its grant of
privileges, there is very little trace of a golden age
save for publicans and portmen. For in 1321 we find
a narrow official class in the noontide of their power.
Since there was no fixed day for elections they had
been used by “lordly usurpation and private covin”
to make bailiffs at their own pleasure secretly without
consent of the people; they grievously taxed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
amerced the commons for their own private purposes;
they used the common seal without the common
consent to the great burden and damage of the
commonalty; and made new burgesses at their own
pleasure without the public knowledge, so as to divide
the entrance money among themselves; and by a
regular system of forestalling and secret sale,
merchants and inn-keepers had combined to rob the
commons of their right to free and equal trade.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
Against these abuses the burgesses sought to repeat
and reinforce the ordinances of the town, but it may
well be doubted whether the customary defiance of the
laws of 1200 was likely to be corrected by the mere
re-enactment or amendment of rules in the book of
ordinances.</p>

<p>For it was not in Ipswich alone that the commonalty
were held at the mercy of a handful of men in
power, without hope of redress through their assemblies
or constitutional methods at home. In 1304
justices were sent down from Westminster to inquire
into a complaint of “the poor men of our city of Norwich,”
where, according to the petition of the commons,
the rich, in defiance of all laws against forestalling,
bought up victuals and goods before they came into
the market, and daily inflicted other grievances on
the said poor men “to the manifest deterioration of
the city.”<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> And again in 1307, “les menes gentz de
la communaute de la ville de Norweiz” appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the king on the ground that an inquiry by justices
had been promised them concerning the fines and
tallages which weighed them down; the poor people,
they said, had been unjustly taxed by the bailiffs and
the rich (“les riches”), “but on the hearing, the
bailiffs and the rich spoke so fair to the said poor
people, promising them redress and that they should
have no cause to complain in future, and that no
tallage should be levied from them without their
common assent, that the poor men ceased from their
suit. But now the said bailiffs and rich have
levied two hundred marks without warrant and
threaten to levy a still higher tallage.”<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The law of
the matter was clear enough, for only a year or two
before the principle that the bailiffs could only
assess taxes “by the assent of the whole of the
commonalty or of the greater part of the same” had
been re-affirmed;<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and the king accordingly sent
answer, “If tallage have been made without assent
of the commonalty, let them have a writ against
those who have imposed such tallage to answer
before the king, and that henceforth it be not done.”</p>

<p>It is, however, hard to say what amount of relief to
the mean folk was actually given by such an order
from high quarters. At the very same time, in 1304,
the people of the neighbouring borough of Lynn were
seeking protection against the ruling burgesses, and
charged them with the usual trespasses&mdash;with assessing
tallages without the unanimous consent of the
community; levying these tallages and other great
sums of money from the poor and but moderately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
endowed men of the community; employing the
sums thus raised for their own use and not for the
advantage of the community or the reparation of the
town; forestalling goods on the way to market; and
establishing and using corruptions contrary both to
common and to merchant law. The great people of
Lynn, however, easily put themselves beyond all fear
of justice by simply buying from the king in 1305<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
letters of pardon and release for the crimes of which
they were accused&mdash;letters which evidently left them
free to go on in the same course. Upon which the
people instinctively turned to their natural ally, the
lord of the manor himself, and through the powerful
aid of the Bishop, and his aid only, were able to win
from the mayor in 1309 the composition which
became the charter of their liberties, according to
which all the “unreasonable grievous” tasks and
tallages laid by “the great men of the town upon
the mean people and the poor”&mdash;or as the Latin
version has it by the potentiores on the mediocres
and inferiores&mdash;and their “grievous distressing so
violently of them,” were to come to an end, and
taxes were henceforth to be assessed in due measure
according to the three degrees of prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that we need not wait for the
fifteenth century to discover an oligarchical system of
administration which was in its full strength in the
English boroughs as early as 1300, and can even be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
traced back at least fifty years earlier. In the middle
of the thirteenth century the commons of Lincoln,
having a dispute with the lord of S. Botolph’s fair
about tolls, formally withdrew altogether from the fair
till they should obtain a remedy from the king; but
two sons of the mayor and two other burghers, rich
traders who did not want their business interrupted,
and who were evidently town officials with command of
the common seal, gave the lord a charter promising a
yearly rent of £10 from the Lincoln citizens, and
this “without any assent or consent of the commonalty.”
It was in vain that the people made remonstrance;
the charter was still binding in 1276,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> and
in 1325 the inhabitants of Lincoln were still without
defence against the “great lords of the said city” who
formed the corporation. While “les grauntz Seigneurs”
themselves paid nothing, the “mean people”
were arbitrarily taxed without their own consent;
they alone were forced to keep the nightly watch;
they paid their murage tax for the building of the
wall, and the rulers used the money for their own
purposes and rendered no accounts to the people;<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
and the pitiful appeal of the commonalty to the king
praying him to provide some remedy for their grievances
only proved how helpless they were to influence
the governing body which was supposed to rule solely
by their consent. In like manner the mayor and
other officers of Oxford were charged in 1294 with
exacting tallages without the king’s order or the
town’s consent, applying the town revenues to their
own uses, raising loans without proper receipts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
collecting money for expenses of the rich on juries and
assizes while the poor were left to pay their own
costs.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Probably the richer party secured the jury,
for the verdict was given against the burgher who
had instituted the suit; but his complaint is so
absolutely similar to those raised in other towns at
the same time that we can scarcely doubt its truth.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>The inner contentions of Bristol<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> and of Andover<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
in the early years of the fourteenth century repeat in
varying forms the same story of a few rich burghers
managing the whole machinery of administration, and
of a commonalty whose voice was often scarcely
heard in elections, who were unable to secure the
just assessment of taxes, or to prevent the money
from being devoted to improper uses, and who
daily saw the laws of trade&mdash;the assize of bread or
beer, the injunctions against forestalling and regrating
and a thousand tricks of commerce&mdash;diverted to
the convenience of the rich officials, while the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
folk patiently expiated their sins before the judgment
seat of the great offenders who sat in careless
immunity on their high places.</p>

<p>It is manifestly hard to find in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries the happy age of the historian’s
dream, when “there was a warmer relation between
high and low, when each class thought more of its
duties than its interests, and religion, which was the
same to all, was really believed in. Under such conditions,”
we are told, “inequality was natural and
wholesome;” and apparently an age of innocence
and peace attested the fostering care of a universal
faith; for according to this theory, so highly commended
and so widely believed, it was only “when
religion became opinion, dubious more or less and
divorced from conduct, while pleasures became more
various and more attainable, the favoured classes
fell away from the intention of their institution,
monopolized the sweets of life and left the bitter to
the poor.”<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Whatever “the intention of their institution”
may have been, however, there is not a
particle of proof that the intention of the favoured
classes themselves did at this time differ sensibly
from that which prevailed at the Reformation; nor
were the dominant folk of town or country disposed
voluntarily to nail their interests on the cross of duty&mdash;whether
we consider the knight “hunting hardily”
hares and foxes,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> and wholly regardless of his oath to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the labourer “to keep him and his chattel as covenant
was between them;”<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> or the lord with his loud laugh
calling for his rent;<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> or the trader filling his pockets
in “deceit of the poor commons,” the alderman adding
field to field, the cook and brewer building their
burgages out of the pence of the poor. The relations
of inequality, in the exceedingly bitter form in which
they were then known, may have seemed natural,
or perhaps supernatural, to an age when all life, social,
economic, and political, was brought under the universal
sway of dogma and superstition; but it is
certain that they were not held to be wholesome by
those who suffered, and whose struggles to win the
freedom so long promised to them in ordinance and
charter fill the town records of succeeding centuries.</p>

<p>For in these young republics formidable difficulties
lay in the way of securing any popular control
whatever over administration. In the first place
the general assembly, which was to be the pledge
of the people’s liberties, and to assure to them
the final word about the taxes they had to pay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the manner in which they were to be governed,
proved in its actual working but a poor security for
freedom. It would seem sometimes that in the hurry
and excitement of expanding trade, men busy in
their shops had as little time or attention to bestow
on serious politics as American citizens of a later
date; or perhaps the very opposite accident might
befall the borough, and a heterogeneous and unmanageable
mob gathered at the place of assembly,
where strangers and unenfranchised journeymen
pushed their way in among the lawful citizens. But
a tumultuous gathering of ignorant and over-tasked
artizans and poor householders crowding from the
narrow lanes of the borough must manifestly have
been a very rare and occasional expedient, and at the
best meant an assembly incapable of real business.
In general it would seem that any small number of
burgesses who happened to be present at a meeting in
the common hall or at the court leet, or a select group
of the better class specially summoned by the mayor,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
were taken to represent the general body of inhabitants,
and their consent was legally counted as conveying
the assent of the burghers at large. From the very
first, and under the most favourable circumstances, it
is evident that the assembly gave no real security to
the commonalty, that through its gatherings they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
never hope to bring sustained or efficient pressure to
bear on the governing class, and that “the entire
assent and consent of the whole community” was for
the most part simply taken for granted. If the
theory of government by the people for the people
already existed in law books and ordinances the
means of realizing such an ideal had yet to be found.</p>

<p>Nor must it be forgotten that from the very
first no man of the people could hope to aspire
to any post in the administration of the town. All
important public offices were confined to persons of a
certain station, and “the rank of a mayor” or “the
rank of a sheriff” were well-known mediæval phrases
which expressed a comfortable social position maintained
by an adequate income. Councillors and chief
officers were chosen from the class of “magnates”<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>&mdash;men
not bound by the law of frankpledge and
possibly holding a position of some authority&mdash;of
whom there are traces in Norwich and possibly in
other cities; or from the “good and sufficient” men
of the borough; or from the class who were technically
known as the “probi homines,” the “good” or
“credible” or “lawful men” privileged to serve as
legal assessors in the civic courts and “credible witnesses”
to bargains, and who had probably come to be
regarded as an official class and gradually organized
into a separate caste.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> This choice of wealthy officials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ultimately depended of course on the custom of those
days by which the chief officers and the townsfolk
were held mutually responsible for defaults; so that
in the interests of the people themselves, as well as
of the king, it was important to secure men of substance
whose possessions formed a guarantee to both
parties&mdash;a guarantee which was by no means originally
a figure of speech, as we see from the case of the
Lincoln bailiffs in 1276, when the receipts for paying
the ferm were diminished, “wherefore they who have
once been bailiffs of Lincoln can scarcely rise from
poverty and misery.”<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The opulent class who bore
the chief burden of responsibility shared the compensating
pleasures of power. We have seen the
primitive simplicity with which at Ipswich twelve
portmen divided among themselves all the posts of
bailiffs, coroners, and councillors; and in fact among
the handful of “worthy” men which could be
produced in modest little market-towns,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
clustered dwellings of wood and plaster, bordering
narrow alleys that ran to the central market-place,
lay almost hidden in fields and gardens, the burghers
had actually no great choice of rulers. From generation
to generation the chief municipal offices were
handed down in the few leading families of the
place. A great merchant would take the command
again and again while the whole town lay at his
discretion, for though a universal law forbade the
continuous holding of office and usually fixed an
interval of two or more years before re-election, either
the law was persistently ignored, or as soon as the
period of retirement had elapsed, power inevitably fell
back to its former possessor.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> How greatly this state
of things was determined by economic conditions we
may see from the fact that in a place like Nottingham,
where wealth was widely distributed, it does not seem
that any single family rose to very marked supremacy;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
and in general a comparison of lists of town officers
indicates that as the growth of trade in the fifteenth
century increased the numbers of well-to-do burghers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and merchants, there was a corresponding variety in
the names of men entrusted with office. At the best
however the upper class was but a little one, and
usually the corporation with its one or two councils
composed of twelve and twenty-four members, or even
of twenty-four and forty-eight, as well as the retired
magnates who constituted “the clothing,” and a
whole army of officials of various kinds, recorder,
town clerk, chamberlains or treasurers, aldermen,
decennaries of the market, bailiffs, coroners, arbitrators,
jurors, and the like, must have absorbed a very
considerable proportion of the well-to-do inhabitants.
A close caste was easily developed out of the compact
body of merchants and thriving traders who formed
the undisputed aristocracy of the town, and whose
social pre-eminence doubtless went far to establish
their political dominion.</p>

<p>And if very little space was practically found in
mediæval times for democratic theories of government,
whether in the conception of a governing class,
or in the working of the general assembly, still less
are they to be found in the prevailing views as to representation.
In the case of Ipswich we have seen how
rapidly the great body of the townspeople retire from
the scene when they have fulfilled their first simple
function of electing bailiffs and coroners. It is the
bailiffs and coroners who nominate the committee to
elect the portmen,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and then the twelve between
them take charge in a general way of the borough
and its affairs, while the commons go back to attend
to their own business and are henceforth only from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
time to time summoned for a general assembly, where
they gather like a Greek chorus to view with official
eyes the progress of the drama, and to applaud in
due form the action of the ultimate executive or express
an expected and resigned acquiescence with all their
will. People talked, it is true, of election by the
whole community, and this was the theory of ordinance
and charter, but the universal fashion of the day
in all ranks and classes was to adopt some more or
less complicated system of indirect election which,
whether intentionally or not, was admirably suited to
the use and convenience of the minority. The nobles
who under the provisions of Oxford formed the
council of Fifteen to assist Henry the Third used
exactly the same devices as were of common experience
among merchants and artizans and burghers;
for not only in trading or in social-religious guilds
were the members accustomed to choose their
governor through a select committee of four, five,
seven, eight, or twelve men; but in the boroughs
themselves the plans by which the sovereign people
delegated their power to a few “worthy and sufficient”
citizens were so ingenious and elaborate that
we may well doubt whether the majority had ever
any chance at all of making their will prevail. In
some cases indeed the leading people of the town
were altogether independent of popular election, and
hereditary owners of the wards sat in the high places
of the hall in virtue of their landed property,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> not of
the people’s will; while in others a guild merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
apparently imposed its own council on the community
at large.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>Nor can we wonder at anxiety to secure an efficient
governing class if we consider for a moment the work
that lay before the council. From the affairs of a pig-market
and the letting of butchers’ stalls they were
required to pass to business of the most complicated
kind&mdash;to constitute a Board of Trade concerned with
inland and foreign commerce; a Foreign Office constantly
busied with the external relations of the town,
whether to overlord, or king, or rival boroughs; a
legal committee responsible for all the complicated
law business that might arise out of any one of these
relations, or out of the defence of the chartered
privileges of the borough; a Treasury Board whose
incomings were drawn in infinitesimal proportions
from the most varied and precarious sources, and
whose outgoings included every possible payment with
which any public body has ever had to deal. The king
might call on them for the supervision of the staple
trade, the management of river basins, the draining
of marshes, the collection of taxes, the administration
of justice, the local carrying out of laws framed by
Parliament, the guarding of the coast, the provisioning
and training of detachments of the national army.
The responsibility thrown on them by the central
government was constantly increased as time went
on; and there was probably nothing which proved so
important in tightening the hold of the oligarchy
on government as the appointment of a certain
number of the upper council to be justices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
peace, having a formidable authority over the working
classes, besides the power to draw into their own
hands a mass of business which had once gone to the
court leet of the burghers.</p>

<p>No doubt the official caste from the beginning
sufficiently appreciated the pleasures of power not to
deprecate their increase; but apart from any question
of greedy usurpation, it was inevitable under such
conditions that a strong government should have
been formed of experts who need not necessarily be
changed every year or elected by a popular vote.
The date at which some custom of this kind became
established is probably much earlier than is commonly
supposed; and there is evidence to shew
that it often preceded by a long time the charters
which make it legally binding. Possibly indeed the
administrative despotism of a narrow oligarchy was
often as old as the independence of the borough
itself. The need for capable rulers may have been
even greater at the perilous outset of its life than in
its later times of confident strength; and when we
remember the imperfection of the primitive machinery
for ascertaining the popular will, the weakness of the
general assembly, and the limitations put on public
election, it is evident that the theory of a free and
equal people electing their own government by the
unanimous consent of the whole community, and controlling
administration by a constant criticism, was a
theory which could never have been practically
carried into effect; which as a matter of fact the
governing class had no wish to encourage, and
which the mass of the governed had neither the
cohesion nor the intelligence to enforce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Once in authority it must be admitted that the
ruling class carried themselves bravely, shirking
neither responsibility nor power. In their splendid
robes of office, with furs and stripes and rich colours
changed at every great occasion to make a more
imposing show, the municipal officers were the dazzling
centre of every procession and public function
in the town&mdash;at Advent services, at the bull-baiting
and public games,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> at the pageant of Corpus
Christi, or the yearly solemnity of recounting to the
people the ordinances and liberties of the borough.
Strict discipline, unquestioned authority, a belief in
firm government, were prominent in their administration.
Of the general body of burgesses and craft
guilds implicit obedience was required, and the
corporation allowed neither discussion nor interference
with its decrees. Windows through which
inquisitive townsmen peeped into the chamber where
they consulted were blocked up; listeners under
the eaves “to hear the words of the council” were
violently discouraged; severe rules forbade the meddling
of too active citizens, and fines and imprisonment
fell on those who “in an abusive manner”
called a councillor a “Fliperarde,”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> or who wickedly
“wished that all the jurats had been burnt in the
common ship,” or with “opprobrious and crooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
words” declared that they were “false thieves,”
or that they “were looked upon at Dover as so
many grooms.”<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Administrative capacity went hand
in hand with the self-assertion and exclusive temper
of a successful class. To the townspeople, amid the
confusion of national revolutions and civil war, the
mayor remained a standing witness to the enduring
forces of an order triumphant over discord and
confusion; as in Exeter, where between 1477 and
1497 the citizens had seen a skilfully organized
revolt shattered before the municipal power, and a
victorious mayor holding office undisturbed under
four successive kings, three of whom had come to
the crown by the violent death or deposition of their
predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>There is perhaps no better type of the superior
town official than the Common Clerk, in his dress of
sanguine cloth striped with violet rays, or of more
sober green bordered with fur.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The business of his
office came into great consideration with the growth
of local liberties. In the fifteenth century there was
scarcely a single town which did not require to have
its “Custumal” written out afresh from the faded and
worn-out copies made in earlier centuries,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> while in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
vast number of cases, where the old French or Latin
was no longer understood by the townsfolk, the writer
had not only to decipher and copy the old tattered
roll, but to translate it.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Perhaps portions of the
gospels were needed&mdash;“enough to swear by.”<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Every
town also instituted the making of its own “Domesday
Book,” its black book or white book or red book
as the case might be, with copies of all deeds, wills, and
charters relating to municipal affairs;<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> and whenever
a legal question arose or local liberties were imperilled
new search was made in the chest containing the town
“evidences” on which the municipal privileges depended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and copies were written out of Acts of Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
extracts from Domesday, Magna Charta,<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> or legal
documents such as the New Tenures by Lyttleton.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
The clerk must be able to translate and to read in the
mother tongue to the community any letters or orders
sent from Westminster. He had to expound legal
technicalities to the council, and to use them effectively
in the town’s interest, not only at Westminster,
but in the innumerable disputes that arose between
borough and borough as to the interpretation of conflicting
charters.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Elaborate accounts of municipal
expenditure were made yet more arduous by the
system of Roman numerals which constantly baffled
his best efforts at exact addition. The keeping of the
town rolls in general was a very serious occupation;
in the time of Edward the Fourth the yearly rolls of
Ipswich (called Dogget Rolls from the clerk’s docquet
or table of contents) form bundles as big as a garden
roller;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> and in Nottingham twenty rolls were covered
within and without in a single year with the list of
pleas against foreigners alone. In fact, the supply of
parchment began to fall short of the prodigious demands
of the town clerks, who were driven to take to
paper, either to economize the trifling sum allowed
them for the expense of parchment, or in obedience
to a direct order from the corporation.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
added roll to roll and book to book, they from time to
time relieved the tedious labour by adorning the town
accounts with sketches and ornaments, with a snatch
of French song or a few quibbles or catches of very
moderate wit,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> with a rugged ballad on the evils of
over-eating,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> or a final sigh of satisfaction from a
German copyist, “Explicit hic totum; pro Christo da
mihi potum!”<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>The town clerk, in fact, was to the local government
what two centuries earlier the trained lay-lawyers
had been to the central administration. From
mere superiority of education, as a scholar and
linguist, an accomplished lawyer, something of a
historian and an antiquary, a skilled accountant, a
scribe trained to finer penmanship and more exact
views of spelling than the ordinary councillor, or even
than the mayor himself, the clerk must have exercized
an easy intellectual supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Responsible only to
the mayor, holding his post year after year in perfect
security, he remained among the changing officers
about him a permanent force, a municipal chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in whom was embodied a continuous tradition of
administration and a fixed jurisprudence.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Thriving
towns of the fifteenth century vied with one another
in seeking out able professionals for the post. Bridgewater
engaged a man who seems to have been in
practice as attorney or notary public in Oxford; and
as early as the fourteenth century a chamberlain of
London wrote letters under the common seal at
Romney. Winchester looked yet farther afield, and
seems to have employed a German.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> An able lawyer
in those days could command the market, as we see
by the story of Thomas Caxton (probably a brother
of William Caxton the printer), who spent a busy
professional career of forty years going from town to
town wherever he could best sell his services. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
native of Tenterden, he was brought up to the law, and
in 1436 was engaged in a plea of debt in Romney
against one William-at-the-Mill. In 1454 he was
practising as an attorney at Tenterden, and was the
leading man of law in its negotiations with Rye to
resist the union of the two towns into a single
corporation. In 1458 he entered the service of Lydd,
which was then in the thick of its troubles about
boundaries and franchises, and was paid £2 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a
year, or double the salary of his predecessor, and in
addition was soon after promised a gown every year,
while ultimately his pay was raised to £4&mdash;a sum
which at that time was only given by great commercial
towns such as Bristol or Southampton.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> On
his resignation Lydd returned to its old custom and
once more paid to his successor the original salary of
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a quarter, but the corporation still continued to
employ Caxton constantly on very profitable terms
for himself, often sending him to London on business,
or to carry on negotiations with the king. In 1470,
when Lydd had been running into danger on every
side, first sending men to fight under Warwick, and
then paying £9 for another body of troops to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the help of King Edward, the burghers made Caxton
their treasurer, and two years later he was elected
bailiff, and a town clerk put under him of his own
training. We next find him in 1474 as clerk in
Romney; but he was called back again to Lydd in
1476, and employed to write out its “customall” in
his fine bold hand. A yet more important town
however now cast longing eyes on the successful
lawyer, and he was drawn away from Lydd to Sandwich,
where he finally settled down as common clerk.</p>

<p>In fact for professional men of talent in the middle
class a new and comparatively brilliant career was now
opened in the towns.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Nicholas Lancaster, town clerk
of York from 1477 to 1480, was a bachelor of laws,
who in 1483 became one of the king’s council, was
in 1484 alderman of York, and in 1485 mayor.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
Easingwold, who kept the rolls of Nottingham for
nearly thirty years (from 1478 to 1506), wrote himself
down as “gentleman” among the yeomen, braziers,
and smiths, who paid their 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> along with him
to gain the freedom of the borough,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> and in his later
signatures still kept up the solitary distinction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
this title, which scarcely occurs in the records save
after his name. An educated man with a very tolerable
knowledge of Latin, though he preferred English,
he served his adopted town well, and in his time the
old court rolls, which had been carelessly kept in paper
books for thirty years before his coming, were replaced
by parchment rolls with very full and elaborate
accounts in a singularly beautiful and exact writing.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that in governing bodies whose
members were thus distinguished from the common
mass of burghers by wealth, social position, culture,
who were independent of the people they ruled,
very watchful in the matter of their legal or customary
rights, and abundantly supplied in case of
difficulty with advice in the law by the recorder or
the town clerk or the special counsel retained in their
service, no influence was wanting which could foster
the official spirit in its most extreme form, with its
pride of position, its administrative pretensions, its
love of legal definition, and its anxiety for “good
order.” “The worshipful men of the great clothing”
or “the imperial co-citizens” of some very minor
borough ruled for their own ends with frankness and
capacity; while their natural rallying cry of “good
rule and substantial order”<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> was so well understood
at court that they could always confidently count
on support from that quarter. The alarm of the
mob, which since the Peasant Revolt had troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
statesmen at Westminster as well as aldermen in the
boroughs, drew the ruling classes generally into close
alliance; and towards the end of the fifteenth century,
we constantly find the town officers turning
with apprehension to the court for aid, and kings
anxiously lending succour to the corporations. The
Wars of the Roses and dynastic quarrels which once
appeared to pass so lightly over the boroughs,
scarcely touching them with a passing alarm of
material calamity, were not brought to a close before
they had left a terrible and abiding impress on the
civil life of the people. The shaking of the national
security, the wild hopes and the panic-stricken fears
of rebellion, had their inevitable conclusion in tightening
the hold of authority. In the boroughs the
governing bodies, terrified at the signs of bitter discontent
in the subject populace, and justly trembling
lest under some feint of political obedience, the mass
of the people might be arrayed against their rulers
and clamour against wrong and injustice might fill
the streets, raised a cry for protection against social
anarchy; and the cry was eagerly responded to by
kings whose title to the crown was their strong will
and heavy hand. The progress of liberty was violently
arrested by the fears that shook the settled
classes before threatenings of revolt. “It seemeth
that the world is all quavering; it will reboil somewhere,”
onlookers said; men walked with redoubled
wariness in an “unstable” and “right queasy”
world,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and while anxious kings urged the mayor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
his council to make good and fearful example of indisposed
commons, aldermen gladly locked the doors
of the town-hall, and cast into the freeman’s dungeon
the burgher who still prated of a free community.</p>

<p class="p1">We do not know when or how the leading men of Bristol
assumed a position of special privilege. All we know is that
troubles grew out of a quarrel about customs in the port
and market, &amp;c., in which fourteen of the citizens “were
seen to have the prerogative,” while the community asserted
that the burgesses were all of one condition and were equals
in liberties and privileges. After many disputes the case was
brought before the judges of the king’s court, but the Fourteen
so arranged matters that foreigners or aliens were associated
with them in the inquisition, which the community alleged to be
against the liberties of the town. Seeing that their arguments
were rejected and that their cause was going to be lost, not by
reason but by favour, the leaders of the people angrily went
out of the judgment hall and proclaimed to the mob that the
judges were favouring their enemies. The whole people, called
out by the ringing of the common bell, flocked into the hall; and
there was terrible clamour and a free fight with fists and clubs;
twenty men were killed; and terror seized alike on the noble and
ignoble, who tried to escape by windows and roofs at the risk of
their lives; while even the judges prayed to be allowed to fly by
the help of the mayor, who himself could scarcely soothe the
“vast crowd of malefactors.” About eighty men were summoned
for the riot, and not appearing before the judges were banished,
but stayed on nevertheless comfortably in the town and were
well cared for by their fellow rebels. It was in fact the Fourteen
who judged it wise to leave Bristol, thinking it useless to remain
in such a storm. (See the extract from the life of Edward the
Second by a monk of Malmesbury given in Seyer’s Bristol, ii.
94.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>To quell this tumult the king in 1312 took the government
into his own hand and appointed Bartholomew of Baddlesmere,
constable of the castle, as custos; but the mayor and bailiffs,
asserting that the letter had not been addressed to the <i>community</i>,
and further that the custody of the town had been previously
given to them, refused to obey orders, and kept the gates of the
castle and town for thirty-five weeks, building a wall against the
castle and refusing to let the king’s men go out to fetch victuals
save at the will of the community. Of their own authority they
made John the Taverner mayor, John of Horncastle and Richard
Legate bailiffs, and John Hazard coroner, without making them
take their oath of king or constable; and by force of arms seized
the custody of the prison, levied for their own purposes the revenues
from the town and port which ought to have been collected for
the king, and administered justice. The king’s judges and servants
were imprisoned or driven from the town; the Fourteen
and half a dozen partizans, who had mostly been in office, were
not allowed to return to the town in spite of the king’s injunction,
and the community seized their goods to the value of £2,000, and
drove out their wives, freemen, and tenants.</p>

<p>The rebellion lasted for two years. In 1316 six citizens representing
the community of Bristol were summoned before the
king’s council to answer for these offences. They denied the
charges, and refused to submit unless life and limb, rents and
land, were secured to them. The king, looking on the case as
one of evil example, ordered Bristol to be besieged by sea and
land, and after attempting to hold out for some days in the hope
that the troops might be called away to the Scotch war, the town
surrendered half in ruins. The leaders were put in prison and
the multitude terrified by a series of heavy punishments. The
banished party returned in triumph to power, and appeared,
twelve of them, before the king’s council, with the allotted fine
of four thousand marks to have pardon for all the city’s offences,
and to have back the franchise of the town. The rebel mayor
and his immediate friends, excluded from mercy, went in their
turn into exile. (See the account extracted from Rolls of Parliament
9 Edward II. by Seyer. Memoirs of Bristol, ii. 89 to 105.)</p>

<p>After this matters seem to have gone on as before, a few
influential families still taking the leading place. One, Turtle,
was mayor ten times, and another, Tilly, held office for four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
years. But in 1344, the popular party insisted on the appointment
of Forty-eight “of the chiefest and discreetest” burgesses,
to be the mayor’s councillors and assistants. When Bristol was
made into a county in 1373 the new charter recognized the system
established in 1344, and provided that the mayor and sheriff with
the assent of the commonalty should choose a Council of Forty,
whose consent was required for all ordinances, and who took part
in municipal elections; while the five aldermen of the wards
were chosen by the people from among the ex-mayors or members
of the common council. By a later charter of 1499 it was settled
that six aldermen were to be elected for life by the mayor and
common council, and were to have the authority of London
aldermen (Charter Henry VII., 1499. Seyer’s Charters and
Letters Patent of Bristol, 123), while the common council itself
was to be elected by the mayor and two aldermen chosen by him,
with the assent of the commonalty.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWN COUNCIL</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fifteenth century has been popularly taken
as the time when victory crowned the local oligarchies
and liberty fled from the English boroughs,
and the restriction of popular rights has sometimes
been attributed to the charters of incorporation given
under Henry the Sixth. In this, as in many other
respects, the luckless age has long lain under a
heavy weight of accusations which might more fairly
be distributed among other centuries; for in most
towns the work of adapting the primitive town constitutions
to oligarchic government had practically
been accomplished long before the days of Henry.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
Indeed it seems as though the characteristic movement
of this time, a movement which naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
sprang out of the industrial developement of the
Middle Ages, was the effort to enlarge the sphere of
political activity. Far from being a time of apathy
in local politics, it was a time of acute excitement.
Townspeople on all sides were awakening to the
sense that the free community of which their fathers
had talked had still to be created; and were making
perhaps the first organized attack on the monopoly
of “the magnates,” and the first practical attempt to
deal with the problem which confronts Englishmen
to-day&mdash;the problem of how to combine popular control
with good administration. Traditions of ancient
rights which the commonalty theoretically held by
law and charter mingled with the ambitions of a new
world of enterprise, and, as we have seen, the manufacturing
classes by asserting their right to have
some share in the work of government, did here and
there for the first time bring the commonalty into
the council chamber.</p>

<p>The problem of government was indeed no longer
so simple as it had been when “the magnates” first
easily assumed the control of the town destinies.
As the centuries went on, bringing their commercial
and industrial revolutions, the growth of capital and
the organization of labour, new standards of administration
and a more anxious vigilance on the part of
the central authority, the balance of power in local
governments began to sway to one side or the other
under the pressure of contending forces. Every
political tendency of the time went to strengthen
the administrative body, and maintain the authority
of the select council. But, on the other hand, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
mass of the commons were neither so poor nor so
helpless as they had once been. The manufacturing
classes waxed fat and kicked. Enriched by trade and
disciplined by industrial training, organized in guilds,
and practised in such self-government as this implied,
restless under growing taxation, clamorous for advancement
in well-being, tormented by petty tyranny, they
were growing into a real power; and amid all the
ugliness and violence and suffering of the troubled
crowd which Langland brings before us at the close of
the fourteenth century, we cannot but feel the stir of
the coming revolution, and of a world transforming
itself under the power of some new force. To the eye
of the contemporary observer the merchants have
become too clever at their business, the lawyers too
shrewd, the common people everywhere too independent;
the poor are less content to starve, and are
looking for the easiest ways of getting hot meat and
ale and comfortable chimney corners; the ploughman
will not work till hunger has buffeted him so “that
he looked like a lantern all his life after”;<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> if the
peasant was for a moment safe from actual starvation,
he was ready to defy the very Statute of
Labourers itself.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> On all sides there is the movement
of a growing discontent<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>&mdash;the criticism and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
impatience that are born of a new hope. We have
a sense of the vague trouble of a people grown too
rich and too busy and too energetic for the old restraints&mdash;a
people that had outgrown its “childish
things.” Nature itself seemed to have been dragged
within the circle of some mysterious change, and its
old stately courses turned into confusion&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Neither the sea nor the sand nor the seed yieldeth<br />
As they wont were....<br />
<span class="ls1 large">······</span><br />
Weatherwise shipmen now and other witty people<br />
Have no belief to the lyft nor to the lode star.<br />
Astronomers all day in their art failen<br />
That whilom warned men before what should befall after.”<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p class="p1">In presence of such a world&mdash;a world in restless
and perpetual movement&mdash;it is difficult to make
general statements of what was likely or “natural”
to happen. In some cases the governing class,
terrified by the new force which was stirring the
masses of the people, eluded any serious conflict by
making terms with the upper groups of the middle
class, thus detaching to their own side the leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of revolt; and a new oligarchy was formed out
of the upper and middle sections of the community&mdash;an
oligarchy stronger and wider than the old,
and with promise of more permanent existence.
In other cases the people had the advantage, and
a more liberal settlement was for a time brought
about in the interests of the commonalty; so
that while the Town Council of one borough
appears as a chosen band ostentatiously arrayed
for the protection of a successful oligarchy, we may
see it figuring in another as the advanced guard
of the commons entrenched in the enemy’s country.
Never, in fact, did any people endeavour to solve
the difficulty of creating an efficient government with
such endless resource and ingenuity as the mediæval
burghers, who as need arose, flung themselves into the
art of constitution making with all the persistence,
temperance, energy, and economy in patching up
ancient models and finding new use for old materials
in which Englishmen for centuries have found their
pride.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> The charters granted to them allowed wide
limits within which they might try their experiments
and plan their own mode of government at their will.
A local scheme of administration was devised; and
when they had framed their system it might depend
on the sanction of local custom, or for greater security
and authority it might be defined and ordained by a
new charter; and if again the chartered constitution
proved unsatisfactory, the townsfolk had only to agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
among themselves on new methods, and have them
once more embodied in a fresh grant from the Crown.</p>

<p>The whole character of municipal government was
thus indefinitely modified by local circumstances&mdash;by
the position or the special industry of the borough,
the nature of its tenure and its compact with the
lord of the manor, the power of the merchants or the
owners of property within its walls; and nothing is
more surprising than the variety and intricacy of
political systems with which the mediæval burghers
were familiar. As free in theory as they were free
in practice, under bondage to no fixed democratic
creed, they adopted indiscriminately any method that
commended itself&mdash;whether of election direct or
indirect, election tempered by nomination, minority
representation, public voting, or arrangements by
which voters recorded their will secretly one by one.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
Every borough, for example, had its own fashion of
choosing its mayor. We have seen that in Sandwich
the whole people made the election; but in Winchester
the council of twenty-four chose two men
and the outgoing mayor nominated one of them as
his successor;<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> while in Southampton the plan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
reversed and the outgoing mayor in the presence of
bailiffs and council nominated two burgesses from
whom the assembly was bound to elect one,<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> nor
could an occasional outbreak of popular discontent
do more than convince the commons afresh of their
true impotence. Midway between these extremes
came an endless variety of customs, often of elaborate
complexity.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> When the selection of the mayor was
nominally left to the whole “people in the hall,”
their choice was often limited and checked in one
way or another. They must take him from among
the upper council; or from among men who had
already served as mayors or sheriffs; or they must
send two names to the first chamber for approval,
of whom this discreet company might choose one;
or perhaps the council itself nominated two or three
candidates for the freemen’s choice, as a curb to the
license of popular judgment; or the matter was
yet more effectually settled by a decision that the
council alone should elect the mayor.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> In some
boroughs a special jury was chosen by the citizens
for the purpose of electing the chief officers&mdash;either
a single jury of twelve as at Bridgnorth,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
double jury of twenty-four as at Colchester or Preston;<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
and the election of the jury itself was often
far from being a simple matter, as we see at Lynn.
Occasionally the necessity of recognizing various
interests within the town and giving to them special
influence in the municipal constitution seems to
have added a local complication, as in Canterbury,
where the aldermen were in early times hereditary
owners and lords of the several wards of the town,
and retained in consequence rights which were not
finally extinguished till the reign of Henry the
Eighth; here two “triours” were chosen, one by
the two outgoing bailiffs together with the aldermen,
the other by the commons or “council of the thirty-six”;
these two triours then appointed twelve men
from among the council, and the twelve finally chose
the bailiffs for the next year.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>In appointing the other members of the corporation
there was the same diversity of method, with a free
use of the plan of nomination, so that a mixed
system was sometimes evolved where half the corporation
was elected by the people and the remainder
nominated by the mayor or council. The town councillors
might be chosen yearly by the burgesses, or by
a jury nominated for the purpose; they might be
turned into a new class of permanent officials by being
elected for life; or made into an exclusive aristocratic
body by being allowed to fill up all vacancies themselves;
and in towns with a double council any two
of these plans might be tried together; or both
bodies might be chosen by some one system. An
inevitable tendency to make themselves as independent
as possible of the people over whom they ruled
naturally guided the councillors to the belief that the
manner of their election was best managed by themselves,
and there were cases where not only the upper
but the lower chamber became self-electing bodies in
which the members held office for life.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>In short every conceivable experiment in government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
was tried in one town or another, or in the
same town at different times, to the great confusion
of systematic order. In one the original council
of twelve or twenty-four might be maintained in
its early representative character;<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> in another its
constitution was gradually transformed. Sometimes
besides the upper council the burghers set up
a second chamber of sixteen or eighty or twenty-four
or thirty-six or forty or forty-eight,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the “worshipful and discreet members of the
clothing,” or the “high election,” had to share their
powers more or less with the “low election”, “the
sad and discreet” company arrayed in plain suits
with no finery of fur and velvet. Hereditary owners
of land might sit on the council of one borough, and
non-burgesses join the council of another. Aldermen
might be forced on the people, or they might be
forbidden by the authorities.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> As occasion served
the townsfolk perhaps attempted to form a representative
council out of a jury of electors or of
arbitrators, or from a committee of the common
assembly, or delegated members from the crafts.</p>

<p>Underneath this apparent confusion certain broad
tendencies can be discerned; and it may be that
with further study these tendencies will be found to
have borne a different character in various districts of
the country, and to have been influenced not only by
political traditions, but by special conditions of trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and industry. As yet there are not collected
materials to justify any general theory; but something
may be learned by observing the constitutional
changes which actually took place in a few boroughs;
and by judging how far these constitutional changes
can be adequately summed up in the theory of a
continuous backsliding from popular freedom to the
despotism of a privileged group of opulent traders.
A few instances which have been chosen at hazard
may serve to illustrate how various were the conditions
under which civic life was carried on, and
how these conditions influenced the political situation,
and were reflected in the temper and form of government.
They fall naturally into three groups.</p>

<p>I. Occasionally it seems to have happened, as at
Southampton, that the original single council of
twelve was retained till after the Reformation, in
spite of sporadic attempts of the commons to vindicate
their strength, whether through the general
assembly or by some other means.</p>

<p>II. In the great majority of towns however a
second council was formed&mdash;in most cases by creating
a sort of committee of the general assembly. Whether
the common people refused to come to assemblies as
was stated at Norwich, or whether their absence was
but a pretext of the governors, it is hard to say; but
apparently a system commonly grew up of calling
together on important occasions a group of selected
citizens. Bailiffs and mayors who were anxious to
get rid of unruly and, as they judged, superfluous
elements in the town meetings; or who wished to
compel a sufficient number of voters to come together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to carry on business; might fall back on the
expedient of sending out summonses to certain
chosen householders whenever an assembly was to be
held, and might thus in informal fashion create a
sympathetic and obedient gathering to endorse the
action of the ruling body. Presently perhaps fines
were inflicted in case the summons was neglected;
and when it was once clearly established that a
definite number of members were thus bound to
assemble at the mayor’s bidding for the conduct of
business, and when further this body was given the
power of the whole assembly in deciding on all
matters that concerned the common interest, it is
clear that a council of the commons had been created&mdash;a
permanent body endowed, whether with or
without their consent, with the burghers’ rights of
legislation. In a number of towns, such as Coventry,
Hereford, Leicester, and many more, the summons to
the council was sent out by the mayor, and the
system to some extent represented a victory of the
oligarchy; we can perhaps trace in Nottingham the
informal growth of this custom and its effects.</p>

<p>III. There were boroughs, however, in which the
second council was the monument of a popular
victory; and of these Norwich and Sandwich may
serve as instances; in Lynn the system was developed
under peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2 mid">NOTE A.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I add here some very brief notes of constitutional changes in a
few boroughs, which took place in the later middle ages. They
all indicate a widespread struggle between the upper and lower
sections of the community during the fifteenth century. A closer
study shows that this movement must not be compared to the
flicker of an expiring flame, but rather expresses the quick
burning of a new fire. In some of the instances given below the
oligarchy seems to have proved the more powerful, in others the
middle class.</p>

<p class="p2">In 1373 the custom of Colchester was that the whole community
chose four “sufficient men” (afterwards termed headmen),
one from each ward, “of good conversation, and who had
never been bailiffs;” and these, being sworn, elected five more
from each ward, who likewise had never been bailiffs, making
together with themselves twenty-four. Two at least of every
five thus chosen were to be of the common council. The twenty-four
elected the two bailiffs, eight aldermen, and other officers.
Then bailiffs and aldermen together chose sixteen of the
“wisest and most understanding people in the burgh;” which
sixteen jointly with them carried on the government. “They
were to meet in assembly at least four times a year; and if any
burgess had a proposition to make to his governors he was to
deliver it to the bailiffs in writing, and receive an answer at the
next assembly.” Edward the Fourth in his new charter
directed bailiffs and aldermen and the sixteen to choose sixteen
other persons, four from each ward, to be a common council
with “power to make reasonable ordinances and constitutions
for the good of the borough.” The first sixteen were afterwards
styled Primum Concilium, the latter Secundum Concilium.</p>

<p>Assemblies were held in the moot hall for electing officers and
making bye-laws. No ordinances could be passed unless twenty-five
members were present. Fines were raised from those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
did not come or who came after the doors were shut. (Cromwell’s
Colchester, 264-5, 269.)</p>

<p class="p2">Canterbury was originally governed by a portreeve appointed
by the king; but at least as early as the thirteenth century the
portreeve was replaced by two bailiffs, who were assisted by a
council of twelve aldermen, or “wisest men,” and by thirty-six
“probi homines” or “jurati.” There is reason to believe that
the bench or chamber of twelve exercised from the first the
powers which belonged to them in the fifteenth century. They
were sworn to keep the law days twice a year, to preserve the
memory of the limits and bounds of their aldermanries, and to
give good counsel to the mayor; they received all the accounts
of the money in the cofferer’s keeping; and with them rested
the power to make all bye-laws. (See the cofferer’s oath in muniments
of city. <span class="smcap">A.</span> 1.)</p>

<p>There were some peculiar features about this upper council.
The six aldermanries of which the city consisted had been originally
held by the Crown “in capite,” but when Henry the Third
granted the city to the citizens to hold in fee-ferm the offices
were annexed to the fee-ferm, and the owners from that time held
of the citizens. The wards, however, still remained the property
of certain families in the county of Kent, estates which
could be bequeathed by will, and which descended for generations
from father to son. Their hereditary governors need not be
either freemen or inhabitants of the city, and might moreover
make their profit if they chose by leasing out the post.
At one time S. Augustine’s held an aldermanry at Canterbury
(Madox, 252); and at the inquisition of 1285 it was proved that
William de Godstede, who held the aldermanry of Westgate from
the community of the city at a rent of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, had leased it to
the rector of Sturry, two miles away, for 100<i>s.</i> a year. At the
same time their position in the city was most influential, for
not only had they the usual police control of their wards as
in other towns, but they were <i>ex-officio</i> members of the chamber
of twelve, who formed the counsellors of the mayor in the
government of the town. There they claimed superior place and
privileges to their brethren, ranking in dignity next to the mayor
and above the other six members of the chamber; the fine for
reviling the mayor being 100<i>s.</i>; for the aldermen, 60<i>s.</i>; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
men of the chamber, 40<i>s.</i>; and for the thirty-six men of the
council, 20<i>s.</i> The council of thirty-six may possibly have arisen
out of the necessity of securing the attendance at the burghmote
of a sufficient number of freemen. Their duties as defined by
the oath customary in 1456 were very limited in character.
“This hear ye, mayor, that I will be true to King Edward and
his heirs, and true attendance make to the mayor of the city or
his deputy at such times as I shall be desired or called, and keep
the days of the burghmote, and truly keep the counsel of the
said burghmote, and all other things do as one of the common
council.” They seem to have had no control over the town
treasure, nor any power to propose laws, and at first had apparently
no power even to reject them. It would appear that
juries were chosen among their body at the burgh court, and
they took part in the election of the bailiffs.</p>

<p>A violent dispute broke out in 1445 as to the right mode of
electing the bailiffs, and when Cardinal Beaufort visited the
city bribes were used to win his influence in settling the quarrel.
The matter ended by the grant of a new charter to the city in
1448, by which the bailiffs were replaced by a mayor. By this
charter, the king gave power to hear pleas and to collect such
tallages as the mayor and aldermen may consider necessary for
the maintenance of the city, but of the council of thirty-six there
was no mention. As early as 1429, however, its share in the
government seems to have been recognized. The name “common
council” was recognized in the oath used in 1456; and that
it represented the people at large is clear from the statement in
1489 that the thirty-six were “sworn to the council of this city
by the assent of all the commonalty of the city.” Finally in
1474 it was decreed that every act or ordinance made by the mayor
and aldermen “with the assent of such of the thirty-six citizens
for the commonalty of the said city chosen as it shall like the
mayor and aldermen” was to be enrolled in the common chamber;
and in this same year ordinances were made by the mayor, five
aldermen, the sheriff of Canterbury, and two chamberlains; seven
names are then given (who may possibly have formed the rest of
the chamber of twelve with the five aldermen already mentioned),
and thirty-six citizens (not mentioned by name) elected by the
community for the public good of the city. In 1497 certain
business in London was said to have been done by order of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
mayor, aldermen, council, and commonalty. (Records of Burghmote
Court. Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 140, 146, 167, 169-173.
Hundred Rolls, i. 49-55.)</p>

<p class="p2">In Shrewsbury, before the plague, twelve men were chosen
who apparently elected the bailiffs, and presented their accounts
yearly to six men chosen by the commonalty. In 1380 the town
was torn by dissensions, and apparently some change had
been made in the municipal constitution, for the commonalty
under the direction of the Earl of Arundel now agreed to return
to the form of government practised at the time of the plague.
This lasted till 1389. Discords and debates still, however, continued,
and the commonalty met in 1389 in the presence of the
abbot and various lords to find a remedy for the misgovernment
of the town. It was agreed that the bailiffs should nominate a
council of twenty-five, which council in its turn should elect for
the coming year the bailiffs, the coroners, and six cessors. The
cessors were to oversee the spending of town moneys and to
make up their accounts for six auditors chosen by the commonalty.
All burgesses were to be present at elections. The
bailiffs only appointed the serjeants. The collectors of murage
might be dismissed during their year of office for any fault. Any
burgess who resisted these ordinances or gave his opinion in the
common assembly was to be punished. Ordinances were to be
read openly every year.</p>

<p>A new composition made in 1433 gave the council of twenty-five
right to choose a serjeant in addition to the two appointed
by the bailiffs; he was to collect the rents due from burgesses
for the ferm of the town. Further, the commons’ rights in
electing the six auditors were affirmed and protected from encroachment
“in deceit of the said commons.” The members of
Parliament were also to be elected by the whole of the commons.
All the burgesses were ordered to attend at the guild hall when
summoned, and the common seal was to be kept by four men
chosen by the commons. Lastly, the bailiffs and commons were
to elect twelve worthy men who were to serve as continual
assistants to the bailiffs for the term of their lives. In case of
death the bailiffs and commons were to elect another councillor.
The burgesses entreat that this composition shall be confirmed by
Parliament because in the case of previous accords the commonalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
could not bring action against the bailiffs for contravention of
them.</p>

<p>In 1444 the council of twelve were given the name of aldermen.
The common council was to act for the whole body of
burgesses, who in the assemblies at the guild hall were no longer
to answer in their own persons, but to show their advice to the
twenty-four who were then to consult among themselves and to
elect a speaker who was to declare their will to the bailiffs and
aldermen.</p>

<p>At the same time the nomination of the electing jury of
twenty-five was taken out of the hands of the bailiff; henceforth
they were to elect two of the common council, and these two
were to appoint the twenty-five electors, as well as the six
auditors and the coroners. The commons were also to choose a
chamberlain or treasurer. (Owen’s Shrewsbury, i. 168-174, 207-9,
212, 216.)</p>

<p class="p2">In Winchester “of the heads of the city should be four and
twenty sworn instead of the most good men and of the wisest of the
town for to truly help and counsel the mayor”; and the mayor was
to be “chosen by the common granting of the four and twenty
sworn, and of the commune, principal ‘sosteynere’ of the
franchise.” The mayor and the twenty-four then nominated four
men to serve as bailiffs, and two of these were chosen by the commons.
For levying taxes six men were chosen “by the common
granting and sworn, three of the four-and-twenty and three of the
commune.” This was in and before the fourteenth century. At
a later time the twenty-four named two men for mayor and the
mayor chose one; while for the two bailiffs the twenty-four chose
four men and the commonalty selected one of them, and in their
turn chose four more, of whom the twenty-four selected one.
The common seal was kept in a large coffer with two locks; one
of the twenty-four was chosen to keep one key, and one of the
commons to keep the other. (Eng. Guilds, 349-50, 356.
Kitchin’s Winchester, 164-5.)</p>

<p>In the early fifteenth century laws, etc., were made by the
mayor and his peers and all the community of the city. (Gross,
ii. 258-9.) The “full assembly” of 1477 mentions the mayor and
fifty-seven of his peers then present (Ibid. 262). It is a matter for
inquiry whether the thirty-three citizens added to the twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
were specially summoned householders, and whether Winchester
followed in its common council the type of Leicester or of
Norwich.</p>

<p class="p2">Leicester had originally a council of twenty-four; and the
commons had a right at first to gather at elections or at a
Common Hall and watch the proceedings of the council. They
had, however, no right to interfere with business, and in 1467
a fine was imposed on any who cried out or named aloud one of
the mayor’s brethren to the office of the mayoralty. In the
fifteenth century there were rumours and speech of ungodly rules
and demeanings among the people, and in 1489 “whereas such
persons as be of little substance or reason, and not contributors,
or else full little, to the charges” still continued “their exclamations
and headiness,” they were excluded as a body from the
Common Hall, and the mayor, bailiffs, and Twenty-four, were
ordered only to summon forty-eight and no more of the most wise
and sad of the commoners after their discretion. In the later
part of the fifteenth century orders were made by the mayor and
“his brethren called the Twenty-four and the whole company of
the Forty-eight, then and there assembled, for and in the name
of the whole body of the corporation of the town.” (Hist. MSS.
Com. viii. 423; Thomson, Mun. Hist. 55-6, 80-84.)</p>

<p class="p2">In 1553 “the mayor and burgesses” of Gloucester claimed to
have had power time out of mind to ordain, constitute, and hold
a court in their Council House, and to call many and divers men
to their council at the same court and to compel and swear them
in of their council. This summoning of additional councillors
seems to have made up the “Common Council.” In 1526 it was
stated that “it has been the custom time out of mind to elect
certain chief burgesses, sometimes more sometimes less in number,”
to form a common council; and the number was then fixed at
forty, twelve of whom were to be aldermen.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COUNCIL OF SOUTHAMPTON</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two grounds on which Southampton
may claim to stand first among examples of early
municipal government. For centuries it was the
great port of the south&mdash;the harbour where for
England the trade of the whole world converged,
where carracks of Flanders and galleys from Venice
met to pour upon its wharves the treasures of the
northern and the southern seas. And for centuries
its government survived, as perhaps such a government
survived nowhere else in England, in the order
appointed by its first planters, with none of its
hedges broken down by compromise, nor its pure
springs stained by infiltration of popular and democratic
fervours. It is possible that the two facts are
intimately bound together, and that the destiny of a
Channel port determined the somewhat unusual lot
of the Southampton municipality.</p>

<p>The industrial experiences of Southampton had been
very felicitous. Nearly forty trades are mentioned in
the town records of the thirteenth century, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
were many more than these, carried on not only by
the English inhabitants but by settlers come from
Burgundy, Flanders, Denmark, and Lombardy, and
the French colony established in Rochelle Lane and
French Street. Wool of all kind was sold in the
market, coarse, black, broken, and lambs’ wool, much
of which was sent to the Isle of Wight to be made
up into web. Coloured “Paris candles” were manufactured
as early as 1297. Cheese was made in great
quantities, and cider. Bends of elms for ploughs
were brought from Abingdon.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Hemp was grown for
the making of cords, and the shipbuilding trade for
which the town was so noted in the time of Henry
the Fifth must have been already practised in far
earlier days, to judge from the history of the Southampton
shipping.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>Home industries, however, held a very modest
position in Southampton compared with the fine
figure made by its foreign commerce. Ships from
the West bringing “cloth of Ireland,” perhaps drugget
from Drogheda or from Sligo, met vessels carrying
wine from the French ports, herrings and wax and
tapestry from Brittany, alum from Biscay and from
Genoa, Eastern spices from the depôts of the Rhine,
while harbour dues were paid for salt-fish, pitch,
bitumen, charcoal, and wood from the ports of the
Baltic.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The great glory of the town lay however in
its direct trade with the Mediterranean. When in the
reign of Edward the Second Venetian and Genoese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ships first began to carry their wares to England they
cast anchor in its harbour,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> and for two hundred
years Southampton became the centre of English
traffic with the Italian republics.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> An attempt to
make it a free port in 1334 came to a speedy
end, but the advantages the scheme offered must
have been practically secured by the privileges which
the kings granted both to the foreign merchants
who came to trade and to the town itself as a
commercial centre. In 1337 the merchants of the
Society of the Alberti in Florence did the carrying
trade of wool from Southampton to Gascony,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
and three years later part of a tenement near the sea
was let to the Society of the Bardi, the Florentine
bankers. In 1378 the King allowed merchants of
Spain and the Genoese and Venetians who carried all
the Levant trade, to unlade and sell their goods at
its wharfs instead of being forced to go to the staple at
Calais;<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> and again in 1402 Henry the Fourth granted
special permission to the Genoese to disembark at
Southampton and carry their goods thence to London
by land.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> From 1353, when Winchester was made a
staple for wool, Southampton as the port from which
alone all its bales must be shipped to the Continent
had a practical monopoly of the southern export
trade.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It was the only harbour to which might be
carried “Malmseys and other sweet wines of the
growth of Candye and Rotymoes, and in any other
place within the parts of Levant beyond the Straits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
of Morocco.” Carracks from Genoa and Venice, ships
from Spain, Portugal, Almayne, Flanders, and
Zealand thronged its harbours, bringing their wines
and spices, and carrying away wool for the weavers
of the Netherlands, or cloth for the dyers of Italy
and the traders of the Black Sea.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Attracted by its
dazzling prospects of wealth, London vintners and
cloth-workers rented great cellars for storage, and
held houses and lands in the town; and so brilliant
was the promise of its future that in 1379 a Genoese
merchant got leave from the king, for the better
security of his merchandise, to occupy the castle
which had just been rebuilt, and promised in return
to make Southampton the greatest port of Western
Europe. But before he could carry out his plans the
merchants in London, furious at so dangerous a
rivalry, had him assassinated at his own door.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Nor was commercial enterprise left to the foreigner,
for even in the fourteenth century native traders were
sending out English ships to do business in foreign
ports.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> In 1391 one merchant took a lease for the whole
year of the customs of the town by land and water;
while another wealthy burgess, William Soper, put
the towers of the Water Gate in repair at his own
cost, and rented them and the adjoining buildings
for a hundred and twenty years, promising to repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and maintain them. At the end of the fourteenth
century the large sums which passed from hand to
hand, and the numerous bonds for payment of debts
from £60 to £100 bore witness to the growth of
trade.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> The wool dues in the port were able to bear
a charge of £100 a year granted by Henry the Fourth
in 1400 for the repairing and fortifying of the
town walls; and in 1417 Cardinal Beaufort, Lord of
Southampton and the greatest wool-merchant in all
England, lent £14,000 to Henry the Fifth on security
of customs on wool and other merchandise in the
various ports of Southampton, and before a third of
it was repaid he advanced another £14,000 on the
same security.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>The prosperity of the citizens was shewn by their
refusal any longer to interrupt business during the
Winchester fair. In 1350 they had already quarrelled
with the bishop on the subject; but he had carried
the day, and the town had again submitted to the old
rules that while the fair lasted there should be no
weighing and measuring at the great beam in the
market place, that if a merchant came carrying wares
he should only be allowed to remain if he swore that
they were not intended for sale, and that the bishop’s
bailiff should live in Southampton during the fair to see
that the contract was carried out. If it was broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the inhabitants were bound, not only in their lands
and houses but in all their goods and chattels, to pay
a penalty of a thousand marks within three months.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
From this intolerable state of things the citizens were
strong enough to free themselves by negociations
with the bishop in 1406,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> and in 1433 they gained
the right to have a fair of their own every year for
three days at Trinity Chapel near the town.</p>

<p>Nor had the town yet exhausted its good fortune.
A law of 1455 which forbade merchant
strangers from Italy any longer to ride about the
country buying up with ready money wools and wool
cloth from the poor people, and only allowed them
henceforth to buy in London, Southampton, or
Sandwich,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> drove foreign traders to settle in the town
if they wanted to carry on their business at all; and
many more were added to their number the next
year when the whole body of Italian dealers living in
London were driven out by a popular riot, and
passing by Winchester, fixed their new homes in
Southampton,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> which must then have contained
within its walls the great majority of all the Italian
merchants in England. The monopoly of the whole
export trade of Southern England was confirmed to
the town by law in 1464; and finally Henry the
Seventh created it a staple of metals, and gave the
exclusive right of melting tin ore to its guild.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Smugglers and illegal traders bore their testimony
to the profits to be made in Southampton waters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Light boats<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> pushed by night into every creek
and cove along the coast to land their casks of
wine; and in the town strange tailors were hard
at work cutting up stuff into garments for the
foreign market so as to avoid the duty on exported
cloth. It was decreed in 1407 that no alien tailor,
coming in a ship or galley, should have any shop,
house, or room in the town for the making of
any “robes, jepone, ne autres garnements” until
he had made agreement with the masters of the
craft; so vessels of “Spayne, Portingall, Almayne,
Flanders, Zelonde, and others in their vyages”
came bringing with them “tailors of divers
nations,” who now however simply abode in their
ships and cut up the cloth there at their leisure, and
in 1468, four years after the monopoly of the wool
trade had been again secured to Southampton, it
had to pass a new law against these plunderers of
the custom house.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Indeed, the magnitude of commerce
at the end of the century may be measured by
the scale on which corruption and false dealing could
be carried on even by the town authorities themselves.
In 1484 two London citizens, one a brewer, the other
a “gentleman, and clerk of all the King’s ships,”
owed to the mayor, sheriffs, and bailiffs of Southampton
£1,200. These officers, however, had apparently
got into some difficulty about the sale of 1,086 sacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of wool in which they were concerned, and drew up
an agreement with their debtors that they would
forgive this debt of £1,200 if they might have a
promise that they should be held “harmless in their
own names, and not as mayor, sheriffs, and bailiffs.”<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>There was, however, another aspect of Southampton
trade. We have a glimpse of the hidden side
of the town life during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries in account books of the Hospital of St.
Julian or God’s House, which owned a hundred and
eight tenements inhabited by working people, the
prosperous ones living in houses of their own, the
more luckless seeking shelter in selds or open warehouses.
But from the one class as from the other,
the Hospital pressed in vain for a rent which the
tenant scarcely ever paid. One of the richer kind is
pardoned 56<i>s.</i> arrears; the attorney is forgiven a sum
of 50<i>s.</i>; the goldsmith who owes £4 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, manages
to pay most of his debt in salt. Others pledge their
carpets; some pay 1<i>d.</i> or 1/2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> at a time for
large accounts against them; in other cases there is
the brief entry “died in poverty and so nothing;”
or poor tenants “run away from the town in poverty,”
and the selds that sheltered them stand empty. Such
is the tale of misery&mdash;a misery scarcely alleviated by
the alms distributed by the Hospital to the poor&mdash;in
1299 three bushels of wheat given in Advent; in
1306 one-and-a-half quarters of beans and twenty-nine
quarters of peas; in 1318 thirteen quarters of beans.
After the burning of a great part of the town in 1337
by a fleet of French, Spaniards, and Genoese, matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
grew yet worse, and in 1340 the arrears amounted to
four times as much as the yearly rents. The Abbot
of Beaulieu owed five years’ rent for the “cheseseld.”
There was due from the five parishes of Holyrood,
St. John, St. Michael, St. Lawrence, and All Saints
within the Bar, £127 in 1340, £155 in 1342.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Large
tenements were broken up into smaller ones where
the people huddled together in their misery, and the
terrible legacy of a very poor population clinging in
extreme destitution to the slums and low suburbs of
the town was apparently handed on to the next
century, for so far as the published records tell,
Southampton was the only town in the fifteenth
century that gave regular out-door relief to paupers.
In 1441 the Steward’s book gives an account of
£4 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> given away in alms every week to poor
men and women.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>In Southampton, in fact, riches did not gather in
the people’s coffers while men slept. Wealth which
was hard to win, was harder still to keep in the
great port of the southern coast, where life and goods
were held by a precarious tenure whenever England
had a quarrel across the water. At any moment
the plea of military necessity might justify all kinds
of irregular and intermittent interference of royal
officers, and the government of Southampton became
a matter of divided authority and shifting
responsibility which was probably unparalleled elsewhere
in England. A special guardian of the king’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ships<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> interfered in the harbour; and a receiver and
victualler to the king’s troops<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> interfered in the shops
and market of the town. The Constable of the Castle<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
long survived the constables of other towns, and was
given powers determined by the court view of the
necessities of the times; so that in 1369, we find a
captain of the castle with authority to arrest all
rebels against the king or the government of the
town, and to watch against regrators, artizans, or
workmen who should offend against the law.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> At a
time when the mayor of most boroughs was commissioner
for array-at-arms, the mayor was here
jointly responsible for military defences with the constable
and apparently took quite the second place.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>Military discipline in fact pressed relentlessly at
all points on a place continually vexed by war and
alarms of war and calls to arms. On Sundays and
holidays all children from seven years old were
called out to practise shooting with bows on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
common, while the town cowherd kept the cattle
out of the way.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> When war broke out every man
had to go out and take his share of fighting, and
no one save the mayor was even allowed to provide
a deputy instead of bearing arms in person. If the
inhabitants had no heart to fight, summary punishment
was meted out as a warning for future times;
and when in 1338 the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses
fled before an attack of the French, the custody of
Southampton was seized into the king’s hands, and
its franchises forfeited for a whole year.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Besides
the cost of three or four ships<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> to protect the
harbour, with wages for masters and men, and money
for their food and rent, Southampton was bound to
have “ready for defence against the foreign enemy
great plenty of armour, weapons, and other artillery
and things needful.” There was a town gunner who
was paid sixpence a day to make gunpowder, gunstones
and lathe-guns.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Generation after generation
of unwilling tradesmen had to repair and maintain
and defend walls over a mile long and from twenty-five
to thirty feet high, with twenty-nine great
towers; and to strengthen the sea-banks and ditches.
The work was divided out among the people; lightermen
and boatmen were bound to bring up every year
boatloads of stones and heap them up against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
walls on the sea side, while the townspeople put in
piles and kept them in order.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The towers were
manned by the various crafts, one by shoemakers,
curriers, cobblers, and saddlers; another by mercers
and grocers; a third by goldsmiths, blacksmiths,
lockyers, pewterers, and tinkers; and so on.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> But
so heavy was the cost of repairs, that after the
burning of the town by the French, when the king,
in 1338 and 1340, ordered the fortifications to be
strengthened and a stone wall fronting the sea built
at the expense of the inhabitants,<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> the people simply
fled away; and the Earl of Warwick and his
successors, under the title of “guardians of the
town,” were posted in its castle with men-at-arms
and archers, “to take order” about the wretched
fugitives, and compel any inhabitants who attempted
to leave the town to return and live there “according
to their estate,” and if they refused, to seize
their houses, rents, and possessions for the king.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
And in 1376 the poor commons and tenants prayed
that the king would take the town into his hand and
forgive them the rent, since for the last two years
they had spent not only the whole ferm which he
had granted them (nearly £300 a year) on the walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
but had been forced to give besides £1,000 of their
own money, so that half the people had deserted
their homes to escape the intolerable burdens thrown
on them,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> and the rest were going.</p>

<p>The long miseries of the Hundred Years War
were soon followed by the harassing problems of
the Wars of the Roses. For Southampton was
reputed wealthy, with its unusually imposing ferm
of £226 and the big roll of the king’s customs, and
there were always people waiting to dip their hands
into so rich treasury. The royal generosities at
its expense were an old story. A large part of the
ferm was settled on successive queens from the thirteenth
to the seventeenth centuries,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and however
low funds might run the town always tried to keep
well at court by paying at least the Queen’s jointure.
Great nobles and servants of the king’s household
were not forgotten, and took their grants as they
could get them, partly in money, partly in wine or
foreign fruits or spices. But when two warring
parties each claimed the treasure of Southampton
as its own, the municipal finances became a perilous
matter for the council to deal with, and the crises
of the Wars of the Roses are marked by calamity
to the town budget.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> In 1457 the ferm was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
made up by contributions from seventeen burgesses
amounting to over £42.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Matters were more serious
in November, 1458, and the mayor had to go
to London, from whence he writes to entreat
the auditors “that ye will, as diligently as ye can or
may, with one heart, one will, and one thought
effectually to labour, that an end be had of the
books of the bailiffs in all haste goodly, and to warn
the steward that was to make his book ready against
my coming home, for we must with all the diligence
we can or may make provision of money to be had
in short time or we be like to be sore hurt, and that
God defend for we have had too much.” One of the
auditors accounts was over £30 too short, “the
which is to me right strange, so much money as he
received the last year and this year too, I cannot
understand it.... I remit it to your wisdoms.”
Another account included nothing but the bare
fees. These matters must be thought on “right
specially” but “if ye will with good heart and
will undivided and without any ambiguity every man
heartily and diligently put his hand we shall once
be brought out of thraldom.” As to political news
he is as cautious as he is anxious. “And so much
to do will be amongst them, God spede the right.” “I
can no more, but I beseech God guide us in all our
work.”<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> A few months after the mayor was summoned
to the Exchequer in London about his accounts,
but before the day was fixed the Lancastrian Lord
Exeter suddenly sent his secretary to the town with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
receipt under his seal and sign manual for the last
half-year’s rent. “Milord prayed us so fair to be
paid here (that is in Southampton and not in London)
and said he had never so great ‘myster’ ne need
that he is paid,” and promised his help in case of
any difficulty in London, “for we told him what hurt
and loss it was unto us.” So the town paid sadly,
and the mayor anxiously wrote to their Recorder in
London to try and get them out of the scrape.
“And [we will] make aready all the money that we
may in all haste possible whatsomever befall,” he adds
earnestly.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>It was indeed hard to gather money at the moment,
for in 1460 the Earl of Wiltshire, Treasurer of Henry
the Sixth, making an excuse to get to Southampton
under pretence of intercepting Warwick, found five
great carracks of Genoa lying in the port, seized them
all with all their wealth, filled them with his soldiers,
provided them with victuals from the town without
payment, and fled to Flanders with his booty.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Then
came the new rulers, and Edward the Fourth ordered
Southampton to pay the treasurer of his household
£133 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and to the Earl of Warwick as
constable of Dover castle an annuity of £154 out of
the same ferm.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> What with one trouble and another
Southampton fell into arrears with its rent, and a
burgess (the very Richard Gryme who had been
mayor a year before and had made the advance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Lord Exeter) was thrown into the Fleet in London
till it should be paid; two of his fellow-townsmen
were sent riding to Westminster “to labour for his
welfare,” and £20 was at last handed over before he
was set free.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The same year the sheriff, also
summoned before the Exchequer, rode to London at
the town’s cost; and he only got off by having his
debt paid by the Recorder, who was afterwards repaid
by the town.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> There was further trouble in 1469-70
when the Kingmaker, as the restored Constable of
Dover under Henry the Sixth, demanded his pension
from the ferm, and the mayor travelled to London “to
reckon with the Earl of Warwick,” and spent twelve
days there, “for the which twelve days the cost
cometh to 50<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Then a few months later came
the other constable of the victorious Edward the
Fourth, and the town had to pay him too and bear
the double charge that year.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>All these financial difficulties were made yet more
acute by the character of the municipal wealth. Of
the £393 which made up the revenue of the town in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
1428,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> £302 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> came from tolls; and the foreign
commerce on which such sums were levied had to be
maintained amid wars with France, quarrels with
Brittany, attacks of Hanseatic and Breton and
Genoese and Venetian traders always on the watch
to seize ships on any plea of wrong done to their
merchants, or in defiance of pirates that swarmed
in the Channel, and of smugglers that haunted the
coast. Again and again the people make complaint
that the foreign merchants that used to bring their
goods no longer came, and for lack of tolls to pay the
ferm the burgesses had been forced to borrow £400
for their rent, and that many citizens had been driven
from the town, and others were going unless something
could be done to lighten their burdens.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>These were some of the special problems with
which Southampton had to deal&mdash;perils of war, its
consequences of military rule and divided authority
within the town, a complicated and difficult finance,
a trade at once wealthy and precarious, heavy expenses
to be met in good times and in bad, a very
poor class living side by side with a very rich one.
The form of trouble might vary from year to year, but
trouble was always with them. Bargainings, abject
petitionings and arbitrary favours, concessions now
on this side now on that, stern exactions and lavish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
gifts, left the town open to endless changes and
chances of fortune.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The general conditions, in fact, must have made
the growth of popular government practically impossible;
and from the beginning the town was
probably ruled by a narrow oligarchy. Its first
constitution was, perhaps, framed under the influence
of a powerful Merchant Guild, such as would naturally
be formed in a wealthy commercial centre&mdash;a fraternity
not unlike the contemporary guild at Lynn
or the latter one at Coventry.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> It seems that in the
twelfth century two king’s bailiffs had the care of
all the royal property, the collection of the ferm,
the gathering in of the king’s debts, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
Meanwhile the Merchant Guild elected its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
aldermen, scavins, usher, and other officers, to
protect the liberties and customs granted to it by
Henry the First and confirmed by Henry the Second
and his sons.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> In 1199 John granted to “the
burgesses” to have their town at ferm,<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and it
is probable that the alderman of the guild was
charged with the collection and payment of the
money, for in the course of the next generation he
appears as mayor of the town.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Both offices, mayor
and alderman, were carried on side by side in his
person. He shared the government with the bailiffs,
as chief of the town and the guild, bound to maintain
the statutes of both, and having the first voice in all
elections concerning both. If the bailiffs failed to do
justice, he summoned the jurors and judged in their
place. He had charge of the common coffer and the
keys of the town gates, and kept the assize of bread
and of ale.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> By virtue of his old title and office the
mayor was still called alderman in the fourteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> and in 1368 he apparently acted at the
head of the guild organization with its four scavins.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>The peculiar position of an alderman of the guild
thus turned into a mayor, is no doubt marked by the
fact that he was never, as in other boroughs, the elect
of the whole community, nor even of a jury chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
by the people. In the fifteenth century it was admitted
that from time immemorial the custom was for
the outgoing mayor, in the presence of the bailiffs and
burgesses, to nominate two burgesses, and the assembly
was forced to elect one of these two, unless they chose
to re-elect the mayor himself, which indeed was often
done. The system was probably that which the guild
had originally adopted for choosing its aldermen, and
which went on unchanged under the new circumstances.
His place as mayor, indeed, seems to have been an
honour slowly and reluctantly conceded,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> for in 1249,
after “Benedict the son of Aaron” had held office
(possibly for eleven years) the burgesses obtained a
royal patent granting that neither they nor their heirs
should ever again have a mayor in Southampton.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
Twelve years later, however, the list begins again,
though in a manner as informal as before, for long
after his authority in Southampton was undisputed,
the mayor was officially ignored in that capacity at
Westminster, and charters from the time of Henry the
Second to that of Richard the Second were addressed
to “the burgesses.”<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> It was only after a charter of
Henry the Fourth, which among other things appointed
the mayor and four aldermen as justices of the peace,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
that the style seems to have changed, and the letters
patent of Henry the Fifth are addressed to “the
mayor and burgesses.”<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> At last, in 1445, under Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the Sixth, Southampton was made a perpetual corporation
to be known by the name of “mayor, bailiffs,
and burgesses,”<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> and this phrase henceforth replaced
the old style.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>With the group of officials through whom the
alderman ruled the guild we have no immediate
concern. But when the mayor had taken his oath of
office in S. Michael’s Church (perhaps in the north
chancel aisle which was called “Corporation Chapel”),
he found himself at the head of an administrative
body of twelve “discreets” and twelve aldermen of
the wards. The aldermen set over the five wards
(three of which were ruled by two aldermen, and the
remaining two by three, making twelve in all) acted
as a kind of police to keep the peace in their respective
wards, to enroll the names of all the inhabitants
and of their sureties, to take up malefactors,
and to make the round every week or fortnight to see
that all was in good order;<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> and it is possible that
they took part in some work of the mayor’s council in
the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The twelve “discreets” were
elected every year by the whole community in an appointed
place, and like the twelve portmen of Ipswich
were sworn to keep the peace, to preserve the town
liberties, to do justice to poor and rich, and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
present at every court.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> They had joint charge
with the mayor of the treasure and the common
chest of charters and deeds, and no document could
be sealed with the common seal unless at least
six of them were present. They themselves elected
the two bailiffs, the common clerk, and the serjeant
of the town.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Finally in 1401, two years after
the same privilege had been conceded to Nottingham,
the charter of Henry IV. gave the discreets
power to choose out of their own body four aldermen,
who together with the mayor were to be justices
of the peace, and were to be aided in their work
by four discreet persons chosen by the mayor and
community. From this time doubtless the mayor
and his four brethren became the chief aldermen of
the five wards;<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> and the town council, as in Nottingham,
elected some of its members to sit as aldermen
in scarlet robes, and some to be plain “discreets” or
“burgesses.”<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>The two charters which finally determined the constitution
of Southampton were granted within a year
of the similar charters to Nottingham. The first, in
1445, which formed a deed of incorporation under the
title of mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, recognized
elections by the official body, a custom which appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in the charter of 1401; while the second made the
town into a county, in order to protect the merchants
and mariners who were incommoded by the sheriff of
the county serving writs on them.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> In the actual
government of the place it does not seem that these
charters brought about much change. The mayor still
presided over meetings of aldermen and burgesses at
the Guildhall in Bargate Tower,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> or in the Audit
House which stood in the middle of the street in the
very centre of the fish, poultry, and pig markets; and
the whole community might be gathered together for
the common business at the discretion of the rulers.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
Nor did the charter of incorporation alter the old
style used in local business. In affairs that concerned
the commonalty, whether it was an agreement with
some other borough about tolls, or ordinances for the
town, or a concord with a neighbour as to the limits
of the town’s jurisdiction, or the leasing of the
customs by land and sea for a year, or grants of land&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
all such matters the ancient custom was to use
the name of the “mayor and community”; and even
after 1445 the old form “mayor and community” is
still retained in all acts that related to public property
and the town treasure, all leases, water supply, fines
due to the Queen, license to hold a fair, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
That the distinction between burgesses and commonalty
was a real one in the eyes of the people is proved by
the fact that on three great occasions when a solemn
consent of the whole town was required, the signature
of “the commonalty” or “the whole community” was
formally placed alongside of that of the official class&mdash;once
in the treaty with the Archduke Philip in 1496;
once in the treaty with Maximilian as to the marriage
of Prince Charles of Spain to Henry’s daughter the
Lady Mary; and once again in an important transaction
concerning the common lands of the town.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>It thus seems probable that administration in
Southampton underwent singularly little change from
first to last, save the raising of councillors into self-elected
aldermen and justices of the peace. Whether
the system of close election by the council recognized
in the charters of 1401 and 1445 was new, or
whether, as is equally probable, the custom was
already of old standing, it seems plain that no
popular disturbance or protest was excited by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
charters. It was not till fifteen years later, in
1460, that the commons rose in open revolt under
the leadership of the sheriff and five burgesses,
and then the battle raged round the election of
the mayor.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> A hundred or more rioters rushed
to the Guildhall, broke in upon the meeting there
with drawn daggers and loud cries, and proceeding
at once to elect their leader the sheriff as mayor,
carried him in triumph on their shoulders, and
set him on the mayor’s seat, while another of the ringleaders
was appointed in his place as sheriff. But the
riot had no great results. The defeated party procured
a patent which declared that their old custom
of election was to be observed, and a mayor was lawfully
chosen by it; but as they were unable to displace
the usurper, the quarrel finally ended in a
compromise whose only effect was slightly to increase
the part taken by the aldermen in elections. By this
new system the mayor and aldermen met in the
audit house a month before the day of election, and
chose four burgesses for nomination; on the day of
election they again met and struck two names off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
list. The remaining two names were proposed to the
burgesses and one of them elected by ballot; the outgoing
mayor let it be known which was to be elected,
and the ballot was a matter of form. The people put
their necks once more under the yoke, and the mayor
nominated his successor and handed on to him the
traditions of office which he had himself received.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>Twenty years later there seems to have been
another impotent effort to reform the system of
election. At this time all such attempts were watched
from the Court with suspicious fear; and Richard the
Third wrote to the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses,
pointing out that by their letters patent they had
truly the right both to elect municipal officers and
to remove them for reasonable cause, and directing
them, since “certain indisposed persons are about
to trouble and vex you in due execution of the said
grant, so to punish the said indisposed persons
as shall be the good and fearful example of others,
and if they be such persons whom ye may not
accordingly punish in that behalf, to certify us thereof
to the intent we may provide such a lawful remedy
in the same as may accord with your said privileges.”<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>In these dissensions it does not seem that the popular
anger was excited by alleged political usurpations,
but simply by corrupt administration, especially
perhaps in relation to public money and the common
lands. There was certainly financial trouble. In 1459,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
as we have seen, the auditor’s accounts had fallen
short by large sums; and as from of old one of the
auditors was appointed by the mayor, and the treasure
chest was kept in the mayor’s house and the keys by
the mayor and discreets, there was probably ground for
suspicion on the part of the people.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The remedy,
however, was slowly and hardly won, and it was
not till 1505 that a very moderate reform was carried
out by passing a decree that the mayor’s salary
should be paid through the steward by the auditors;
“to the intent following that no mayor from this day
forward take upon him to receive or handle any of
the town’s money, that is, to wit, he shall make no fine
except it be at the audit house, calling to him two or
three of the aldermen or of the discreets at the least,
and the money thereof coming to be put into the
Common Box in the said audit house.”<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> In course
of time it was also ordered that the common chest
should be kept in the guild hall<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> instead of the
mayor’s own house.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1459, there was probably some
alarm also as to the common lands.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> The 376 acres
of Southampton Common, the various closes, the
God’s House Meadow, and the Saltmarsh, were, as we
have seen, the special care of the “community”;<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
and a quarrel had been going on for centuries with
S. Julian’s Hospital as to a tract of marsh which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
claimed by the town as part of its common in spite
of all the fences raised by the warden of S. Julian’s to
vindicate his claims.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> In 1459 a new warden perhaps
suggested the plan which he carried out a few years
later, after the failure of the popular revolt, when he
disseised the town in 1466 of a part of the great
marsh or common, having bought over the mayor by
a grant of some of the land in question to be held
of the hospital. Under a later mayor in 1471 the
burghers again broke down the fences put up by
the hospital,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> and appealed to the king and council
to defend their ancient privileges. “Ancient men”
(one aged 104 and more) gave their depositions as
to boundaries,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and an award was finally made in
1504, followed by the necessary legal settlements, in
1505. A new quarrel arose when the corporation
attempted to raise a tax for keeping up the sea-banks
or cutting sluices to save the fields from floods;
and proposed, if this failed, to enclose and hire out
a part of the common land to pay these expenses.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
The townsmen, on the alert for danger, sent in eager
declarations that the poor commons “will be ever ready
to withstand all manner of persons with their bodies
and goods that would attempt to usurp upon any point
or parcel of the liberties and franchises of the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>”
They would not hear of letting any part of the
common; as to paying any money for sluice, bridge,
or cut made by the corporation, “they pray your
wisdoms in that matter to assess none of them, for
they intend to pay none in no wise”; unless indeed
some better and happier times might befall them,
“remembering your poor commons are not as yet at
a fordele in riches, trusting to God to increase under
your masterships.”<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> The period of wealth, however,
tarried, and so did the taxes; so a few years later the
corporation ordered part of the marsh to be enclosed.
Upon this three hundred of the commons, men and
women, marched out to the waste, broke down
fences and banks, and triumphantly proceeded to the
guild hall, making “presumptuously and unlawfully
a great shout” to the annoyance of the court within.
Flushed with success they next walked two and two
in procession with their picks and shovels to the
mayor’s house near Holy Rood Church and Cross, and
one cried out, “If master mayor have any more work
for us we be ready”; after which they went home
without doing further harm. Four days later one of
the king’s council came down with letters ordering
the arrest of the chief offenders, and perpetual
banishment was proclaimed against the ringleaders
who had fled, while six other men were seized, taken to
London, and put in the Marshalsea. The Southampton
rioters were struck with terror and repentance.
Petitions were got up in every parish for the
prisoners; the town promised to restore the banks,
and never sin again in like fashion; the corporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sent out a proclamation that all those who had taken
part in breaking down the banks should go out to
build them up again, and only when this was done
was the petition for mercy forwarded to London.
Finally, sentence was given by the cardinal and the
council that the prisoners should be sent home, and at
their coming to Hampton should sit in the open
stocks under the pillory, till the mayor and his
brethren and the king’s lieutenant walked down the
street, when the penitents were to plead for mercy
and forgiveness and confess their guilt. All this was
done; the mayor, in the name of his brethren, magnanimously,
of his great mercy, accepted the apology
and promised that no grudge should be borne against
them. “And thereupponne [he] commaunded them
owt of the stokkes, and hadd them to the audite hous,
and bound them by obligacon to be good aberying
ageynst the kinges grace and the mayor and his
brethryn hereafter, and so delyveryd them.”<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> The
municipal dignity was vindicated, though the quarrel
was still left to drag on for the next two hundred
years.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of irritation over questions of financial
fraud and the management of the common lands,
however, there seems to have been little political
activity in Southampton. The civic life stretches
out before us like stagnant waters girt round by
immutable barriers. Scarcely a movement disturbs
its sluggish surface. The twelve perpetually gather
round the mayor and rule the town with a despotic
power which hardly suffers change during the centuries
from John to Henry the Eighth. Even the
modest claim of townsfolk for some closer connexion
with their mayor only reveals with what a steady
hand the venerable oligarchy maintained its ancient
discipline. Against their consecrated order the
commons from time to time made a riotous and
disorderly protest;<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> but there is no attempt to bring
about real constitutional reform. We scarcely hear
of the general Assembly; there is no appeal to old
traditions of freedom; no talk of a representative
council of the commons; no organized resistance
of the crafts&mdash;possibly because these, however
numerous, were too poor and weak (if we may judge
from their inability to maintain the walls and
towers, even when grouped together) to make head
against a very powerful corporation. Mere outbreaks
of unorganized and intermittent revolt, which
were occasionally kindled by some grave scandal,
died away fruitlessly before the steady resistance of
the authorities in power, and such paroxysms of
transient activity on the part of the people remained
without permanent result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Southampton had, in fact, a peculiar history and
a fixed tradition in government, which left its people
in a singularly helpless position before authority.
The conditions, political and commercial, of its municipal
life necessarily gave the expert a supreme place
in administration; and it is possible that a compact
body of merchants had from the first imposed their
methods of government and election on a population
who had no voice in the matter. The state of affairs
was exactly reflected in the attitude of the mayor,
who held a place of singular pre-eminence and might.
Far removed from popular criticism or control, as
direct minister of the king<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> he conducted a vast
mass of business in absolute independence, both
of the community and of the guild, not only as
being the king’s escheator, the gauger and weigher of
goods at the king’s standard, and measurer over the
assize of cloth, the mayor of the staple of wool, and
mayor of the staple of metals under the king’s orders,
but also as the king’s admiral within the town
and its liberties, with supreme control of the port and
coast from Christ Church Head to the Needles thence
to Hill Head at the mouth of Southampton Water,
over the port of Cowes and of Portsmouth;<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> and
even as a sort of secretary for foreign affairs, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
must remember that nowhere, save in London, was
the “foreign” question so big and important. Settlers
from France or the Netherlands, such as those in
Sandwich or Norwich, who took up their dwelling
there and became absorbed in the general body of the
townsfolk, formed a very different class from the
merchant visitors who flocked to Southampton to look
after business interests which extended all over the
country, and to a great extent conducted the whole
carrying trade of the south; and who, as strangers
under the peculiar protection of the king, constituted
a foreign colony, ruled by special laws and kept under
special supervision.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> In all these different departments
of his government the mayor ruled by other laws than
the municipal ordinances; he did not need the
municipal seal for his decrees, nor the assent of the
community for his acts; and the great departments
in which his actions were removed from all possibility
of local criticism, and local control must have
made absolute rule the easier and less singular in all
other relations of his office.</p>

<p>Nor ought we to forget wholly the outer influences
which were acting on Southampton from the world
beyond the water. With Flanders it seems to have had
little direct communication. So long as the Mediterranean
galleys carried its wool to the Netherland ports,
and returned to pick up their freight for the homeward
journey, the associations and commerce of Southampton
were with the great cities of Italy, too far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
removed from it in every conceivable respect to serve
as schools of political freedom; and with the communes
of France whose liberties had long suffered
decay, and in the fifteenth century were finally
extinguished by the policy of Louis the Eleventh, the
subtle enemy of popular liberties.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> It is hard to
tell how far Southampton may have been affected
by such foreign associations, but at least they did not
tend to weaken the influences at home which made
for oligarchic rule. Undoubtedly if we compare this
town with other English boroughs where civic life
was more free and expansive in its growth, the municipal
record, in spite of its brilliant commercial side,
is one of singular monotony, and leaves us with the
sense of a stunted developement in the body politic.
Southampton, in fact, was by its position and dignity
called to play so great a part in the national history,
both in war and commerce, that all claim to private
and local independence was superseded. At a far
earlier date than other towns its destiny was merged
in the fortunes of the whole commonwealth,<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> and
the king suffered no deviation from the service required
of it to the state. In a very remarkable way
Southampton anticipated the history of boroughs
which under the Tudors were drawn into the same
duty and service; through successive centuries its
burghers acquiesced in the expert administration of
a small official class, scarcely fettered by popular
control; and abandoned the pursuit of new ideals of
communal life or new experiments in government.</p>

<p class="pch">THE COUNCIL OF NOTTINGHAM</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Problems</span> of government sat lightly on the people
of Nottingham. Singularly favoured as it was by
fortune compared with many other towns, there is
something phenomenal in the record of a town so
tranquil, so uniformly prosperous, so exempt from
apprehension, with so complacent a record of successful
trading and undisturbed ease. Administration was
carried on in its simplest form, and few sacrifices were
demanded of the inhabitants, whether of labour or of
money, compared with the efforts which were required
of less fortunate towns. The interest, in fact, of its
history lies in the quiet picture that is given of a
group of active and thriving traders, at peace with
their neighbours, and for the most part at peace with
themselves.</p>

<p>The position of Nottingham was one of great
military importance; for lying almost at the centre
of the kingdom, the town held the approach to the
one bridge over the Trent by which the main road
from the south struck northward: and further commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the navigation of the river from the point
where, broadened by the confluence of the Derwent
and the Soar, it became a great highway of internal
communication. Throughout its history, therefore,
from the time of the Danes down to the time of the
Civil War, Nottingham could not be left out of
account when any fighting was going on. But
England was in the main a land of peace, and the
occasional and intermittent importance of an internal
fortress was wholly different from the consequence
that attached to a border castle like that of Bristol,
or to outposts against foreign foes such as the walled
seaport towns of the coast. Hence the military
advantages of its site made but little mark on the
character and history of the town, and the castle
which crowned the sandstone cliff that rose precipitously
from the waters of the river Lene played no
great part in the life of the mediæval borough.
Lying well out of reach of all foreign foes, it fell
into no misfortunes such as Rye, which was destroyed
by fire twice in half a century, nor was it impoverished
by taxes for defence against the French such as
threatened to leave Southampton desolate; and its
merchants were only occasionally required to make contribution
towards the protection of the coast and the
safety of the sea-borne trade which added to their
wealth and luxury. Thus, when the keeping of the
sea was given in 1406 to the English merchants, their
elected Admiral of the Fleet, Nicholas Blackburn,
wrote a peremptory order to Nottingham for £200 as
its share of the cost;<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> but the merchants’ experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
failed, and they were relieved of their responsibility
before they had levied any second toll.</p>

<p>But the same geographical position which, under
other circumstances, would have made of Nottingham
a strategic centre, did under the actual conditions of
English life assure the fortunes of the borough in
industry and commerce. By land and by water, trade
was almost forced to its gates. The bridge which
spanned the Trent, after it had fallen into ruins as the
property of the kings, was granted by Edward the
Third to the townspeople, who willingly undertook the
heavy charges of its repair and maintenance; each
division of the town territory was made responsible
for one or two of its nineteen low arches,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> and the
wardens appointed to oversee the whole appeared from
time to time before the municipal officers with laborious
and portentous accounts. Over this bridge all traffic
from south to north was bound to pass; while boats
from Hull and the eastern ports travelled up the river to
unload at the quays of Nottingham. Thus the burghers,
more fortunate than those of Canterbury, Norwich, or
Shrewsbury, had no cause to fear the troubles of a
shifting commerce, of manufacturers driven away to
seek for brighter prospects, or of merchants forsaking
the old ways for some new trade route. A uniform
prosperity seems to have reigned in the town. Traders
of every kind were in 1395 winning more than the
law allowed them,<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> and the market-place, which is said
even now to be the largest in England, was covered
with booths; there were twenty fish-boards, thirty-two
stalls in the Butchers’ House, thirty in the Mercers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>’
House, twenty in the Drapers’ House, and so on, the
rents of which were rapidly rising in the second half
of the fifteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> and the stately Guild Hall,
besides its council room, and its upper prison for
felons and gaols for debtors with iron grating to the
street, had its storage room for merchandise. Buyers
and sellers crowded to the market, for new burgesses
were still willingly admitted<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> on the payment of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
and it was only at the close of the next century that the
ready hospitality of the town gave way to a jealous exclusiveness.
Strangers without number paid for license
to trade, besides rents for stalls or shops;<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> and the
number of suits between burgesses and “foreigners”
or non-burgesses, was so great that sometimes in a
single year twenty rolls or more were closely written
on both sides with the records of these suits alone&mdash;a
fact which points to trade dealings with the outer world
on a scale quite unknown to previous times.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Even
the geological position of the town added to its sources
of wealth, and the corporation as well as traders made
profit from the neighbouring coal-mines.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> All kinds of

when probably there were few places in England where
cloth was dyed, bales were sent to Nottingham to be
coloured red, blue, green, and tawny or murrey; and
if their scarlet dye was liable to turn out not scarlet
but red<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> even in 1434, we must remember that at this
time for a fine scarlet dye English cloth had to be
sent to Italy.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Nottingham manufacturers made linen

when capital was scanty the burghers had accumulated
in their coffers good store of gold and silver.
But a general air of substantial comfort and well-being
seems to have pervaded the town. The subsidy
roll of 1472 which gives a list of 154 owners of
freehold property, from one whose tenth was 74<i>s.</i> 7-1/2<i>d.</i>
down to one whose tenth was set down at 1/4<i>d.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> the
inventories of household goods, and the legacies which
occur from time to time, show a considerable class of
citizens living in wealth and luxury, and a yet larger
class of comparatively well-to-do people after the
measure of those times. While the richer merchants
were building or adorning with handsome carved oak
houses which a later age called “palaces of King
John,” humbler tradesmen contented themselves with
homes such as are described in a builder’s contract of
1479, where the little dwelling with a frontage of
18 feet on the street, was to have two bay windows
and to cost altogether about £6.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Before the latter
part of the sixteenth century<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> at least there is no
indication of poverty such as we find in various other
towns, in Southampton, or Romney, or Chester, or
Canterbury&mdash;all places which had to suffer from
special causes of distress&mdash;and even the wills do not
contain the frequent bequests for the relief of the
poor and of prisoners which occur in places where the
calls of distress were more pressing and insistent.
The financial problems of the corporation were
perfectly simple and regular, and presented no more
formidable difficulty than the keeping in repair of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
great bridge. When the ferm of the town was
reduced to £20 by Edward the Fourth it was done,
so far as the municipal records tell the tale,<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> without
any of the complainings of utter misery and desolation
by which such favours were commonly won; and
in the next half century there is no more serious hint
of distress than is marked by the fact that in 1499
two of the butchers’ stalls and a few other holdings
were lying vacant, and that the Corporation had
borrowed some small sums.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Nottingham was unfretted too by trouble from
without. Set on the outskirts of Sherwood Forest,
but exempted since the time of John from the Forest
laws and the jurisdiction of the Forest officers,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> its
very position tended to free it from the neighbourhood
of any powerful lord who could threaten its
citizens, diminish its rights, or tax its people with
petty wars or law-suits, as Liverpool and Bristol and
Lynn were taxed and harassed. In its only trouble&mdash;an
occasional dispute as to the control of the waters
of the Trent&mdash;it was invariably supported by the
Crown. Sometimes weirs and fishing nets obstructed
the river; sometimes when the water was low boats
coming from Hull had to be dragged along from the
banks, and the river-side owners demanded fines for
use of the towing path, so that the price of goods in
Nottingham was increased to “a great dearness.”
Then the Nottingham men would hasten to move
the king by “a clamorous relation”; and forthwith
royal commissioners were sent down to inquire into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the obstructions; royal proclamations were issued to
forbid the exacting of river-side tolls; and royal
orders forbade the neighbouring lord of Colwick to
divert the waters of the Trent to his own uses to the
injury of Nottingham.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>Nor were its burghers troubled by claims of any
ecclesiastical power within the town walls, such as those
which vexed Norwich and Exeter and Canterbury.
Ecclesiastical interests indeed play no great part in
Nottingham. Two churches already existed under
Cnut, and before the fourteenth century one more was
added.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> But no abbey had been founded within its
liberties, and the yearly journey of the mayor and
his brethren to carry Whitsuntide offerings to the
mother church at Southwell was but a picturesque
ceremonial that recalled the time when Paulinus first
founded there a centre of mission work among the
pagans.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>As for Court factions and dynastic intrigues, distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
traders with much work of their own on hands were
generally prompted by a prudent self-interest to
side with the dominant power in the State. The
burghers easily transferred their sympathies from the
Lady Anne of Bohemia to Henry the Fourth;<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> they
stood by Henry the Sixth so long as the triumph of
the rebels was doubtful, but no sooner were the
fortunes of Edward the Fourth in the ascendant than
by gifts out of their treasure and little detachments of
their militia they testified to a new loyalty, and thus
obtained the renewal of their charter and a reduction
of their ferm for twenty years, “to have a reward to
the town of Nottingham” “for the great cost and
burdens, and loss of their goods that they have
sustained by reason of those services.”<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> In 1464 they
ordered off a little troop in red jackets with
white letters sewn on them<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> to join the king at York,
and once more at Edward’s restoration in 1471,<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> the
town spent about £60 for “loans for soldiers” and
liveries, besides many other costs. In October of
1482, the jury “presented” an offender charged with
wearing the livery of the intriguing Richard of
Gloucester;<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> but before the battle of Bosworth the
town hospitably entertained Richard himself, and
in its castle he received the Great Seal;<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
no sooner was the day lost for York than a deputation
was sent in hot haste to make peace with
Henry the Seventh and obtain a safeguard and
proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Stall-holders and burghers, in fact,
intent on their own business, only asked that Court
quarrels might be settled with the least possible
trouble to themselves; and throughout the Wars
of the Roses the Nottingham men did just what
the men of every other town in England did&mdash;reluctantly
sent their soldiers when they were
ordered out to the aid of the reigning king, and
whatever might be the side on which they fought, as
soon as victory was declared hurried off their
messengers with gifts and protestations of loyalty to
the conqueror. Meanwhile they went steadily on
with the main business of trade and watched the
rents of their booths and the profits of their shops
going up and their wealth constantly accumulating.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>Like all boroughs that held under the Crown,
Nottingham won very early the rights of a free
borough. Henry the Second from 1155 to 1165
granted its burgesses freedom from toll, a market, the
monopoly of working dyed cloth within the borough,
and free passage along the Trent; and further gave
them power to tax inhabitants of all fees whatever
for common expenses.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Originally governed by a
reeve who collected its yearly ferm and managed its
affairs on behalf of the king, Nottingham obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
charter from John in 1189 a Merchant Guild, and leave
to elect a reeve of the borough who should answer for
the ferm to the Exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> In 1230 the burgesses
were allowed to appoint coroners, and (the ferm being
fixed at £52) to levy a tax for weighing at the common
scale all goods brought to the town.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> A charter
of 1255 granted them the freedom from arrest for
debt which was being so commonly given at this
time; the return of writs; and an order that no sheriff
or bailiff should interfere in the exercise of justice in
Nottingham unless “the burgesses” had not done
their duty. And ten years later they were freed from
the aid of 100<i>s.</i> formerly paid to the sheriff for his
good will and that he should not enter their liberties.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>In the reverses of the Welsh war, when Edward
the First summoned two great provincial councils of
knights and burgesses to bestow a grant for completing
the conquest of Wales, Nottingham used his
necessities to secure its own profit; for three years the
town had been in disgrace, with all its franchises forfeited,
but in 1284 it not only regained them, but won
permission to elect a mayor “by unanimous consent
and will” of “both boroughs of the same town”&mdash;that
is the French and the English boroughs which
from the time of the Conquest had been established
side by side, each governed by its own bailiff<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
according to the different laws and customs of the two
peoples. During the Scotch war in 1314 their position
as masters of the northern road possibly disposed
Edward the Second to grant readily any favours they
might demand; and immediately after Bannockburn
they received power to hold all pleas before the
mayor, and alien sheriffs or bailiffs were forbidden to
enter the borough.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Yet later one of the first acts of
Henry of Lancaster, after the deposition of Richard
in 1399, was to make interest with the keepers of the
stronghold of middle England. He gave lavishly all
he had to give: the assize of tenure formerly held
before the judges; all fines, forfeitures, and ransoms
which had not yet been handed over; the election of
four justices of the peace; the placing of the mayor
upon all commissions of array of men-at-arms, so that
neither sheriff of the county, nor officer of the court
could henceforth tax the town for military aid without
his assistance and consent.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> In 1448 Henry the
Sixth completed the emancipation of Nottingham by
granting it a charter of incorporation under the title of
“the mayor and burgesses of the town of Nottingham.”
By this charter the town, with the exception
of the king’s castle and gaol, was entirely separated
from the county and made into a shire; its bailiffs
became sheriffs, and were henceforth not to go out of
the town to take their oath, but were to be sworn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
before the mayor; and the mayor himself was made
the king’s escheator.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> If the king in these difficult
times, with Normandy almost lost, and England on
the eve of rebellion, offered bribes for loyalty, he
required a due return; and in 1450 the Nottingham
men had to pay their part of the bargain, by hiring
men to go to the help of the sovereign at Blackheath
against Jack Cade, which they accomplished by
leasing some of their common lands for a sum of
£20 to be paid in advance.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, owing to the loss of the Old Red
Book of Nottingham and other records, it is only
by piecing together scattered hints and fragments
that we can discern anything of the early constitution
of the borough. In the first charters or official dealings
with the court, we hear of “the Burgesses” only,
with no mention of reeve or bailiff; until after the
creation of the mayor in 1284, when the formal style
is changed to “the Mayor and Burgesses.” Whatever
was the actual significance of the term “burgesses”
we know that it already had a technical meaning, for
a charter granted by Edward the First to “the Burgesses
and Community of our town” in the days
before the mayor had replaced the reeve,<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> shows
that even then the two words were used in a
special sense; and this original distinction remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
throughout the records of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries. In general, the business of the
town was done in a somewhat elaborate manner by
“the mayor, burgesses, and community,” or “the
mayor and his co-burgesses and the community”;
but it seems that there were some affairs which were
given over to the “mayor and burgesses”&mdash;an occasional
treaty with another town,<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> or the letting of
tenements or property acquired by the corporation
and set apart for special public purposes such as
the ferm, or of lands assigned for the expenses of
the bridge; while on the other hand, where the
common property of the people in house or land
was in question transactions were carried out in the
name of the “mayor and community.”<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
perhaps no more than two cases before the middle
of the sixteenth century in which common lands
were leased by the “mayor and burgesses,” and
these happened as late as 1511 and 1514, and
were probably acts of a specially corrupt administration.</p>

<p>By the Nottingham folk themselves, therefore, the
word “burgesses” was from the thirteenth century
onwards applied to a body which could be distinguished
from the commonalty; and in the use of
the words we seem again to catch the double meaning,
first of the corporate body of citizens as opposed to
the ancient “communitas”; and then of the governing
council or assembly as opposed to the whole
congregation of the freemen. When this secondary
use of the words grew up in Nottingham we cannot
say, as we know absolutely nothing of the early
government of the town. It is only through one or
two brief notices which have been saved from the
general destruction of old records that we detect the
presence in the council chamber of a recognized
group of officials or councillors; and these notices
belong to a late time. Meetings were held in the
town hall in 1435 and 1443, in which a council
of justices of the peace and “trustworthy men”
did business with the consent of the commons;<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
and in 1443 we hear of a fine to be paid by
“burgesses” who neglected to come to the hall
when summoned, the fine being (as we learn
from other towns) the customary sum levied from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
absent members of a regularly appointed council.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
And from another entry copied from the records of
three years later we know certainly that a council of
twelve did exist in 1446. “Ordered that twelve and
the mayor chosen to order, end, and dispose of as
they think meet of all things belonging to the
commonalty of the town without interruption or
contradiction of any person within the town. All
orders are with the consent of the commonalty.”<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>Whether the order of 1446 was the bringing in of
a new method of administration, or an extension of
the powers of an established council, or merely a
declaration of the law that it should do its business
“without interruption or contradiction” of any of the
townsfolk, we cannot certainly tell, for the old Red
Book is lost and the phrase is only preserved for us in
a note made by a town clerk a hundred and fifty
years later, whose comment on it, “And there shall
you see the erection and election of the council,” is
of little value in deciding the matter.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> In the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
of any direct evidence, the traces of an earlier
council certainly suggest the idea that in the twelve
we may have the successors of a body resembling
the twelve portmen elected in royal boroughs for
the general administration of the town, and that
from 1399 the four justices of the peace formed
part of this council. The commonalty had the right
of entering the town hall during the meetings of
the council, and of confirming the ordinances of the
governing body by their “assent and consent”;
and these powers might of course be more or less
left in suspense or fully exercized as opportunity
required. No doubt in a big and busy borough any
frequent gathering of the townspeople was impossible,
and it is very probable that (as at Sandwich), when
the mayor did business in the borough court, any
burghers who happened to be present<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> were taken to
represent the general assembly of the commons, and
bye-laws or necessary orders passed by them were
understood to have received “the consent of the
community.” In the majority of instances the
numbers who attended were probably few, but their
presence is from time to time distinctly marked,
as in the meeting of 1435; in the assembly of a
hundred and thirty burgesses in 1463 to make laws;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and in the calling of the commons together in their
common hall in 1480.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>If the administration followed this well understood
routine, it is probable that the conduct of public
business underwent no great change when two new
charters, in 1446 and 1448, settled the final order of
government in Nottingham, and made it into a
county. No mention was made in these charters of the
existing council (unless indeed the term “burgesses”
was commonly understood to mean the council),<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> but
by the second in 1448 it was enacted that “the
burgesses” should elect from time to time <i>from
amongst themselves</i> seven aldermen (to answer to the
seven wards of the town), one of whom was always
to be mayor, while all the seven were to be justices
of the peace. The aldermen were to hold office for
life, and in their scarlet livery with suitable furs
and linings, after the fashion of the aldermen of
London,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> were manifestly the leading members of the
council; and the six burgesses who completed that
body were within a few years known as “common
councillors,” to distinguish them from the heads of the
wards.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> The constitution of the Nottingham council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
seems in fact to have been exactly the same as
that of Canterbury or of Southampton; and here no
doubt, as in other places, the official governing body
did at some time take to itself in a special sense the
title of “the Burgesses,” leaving that of “the Community”
to the freemen at large.</p>

<p>The new charter, whether it introduced any change
in older methods or no, at least seems to have awakened
no resistance. A Council of Twelve which ruled
before 1448 ruled in like manner afterwards, though
now seven justices of the peace sat in it instead
of four. As for what may seem to us the crucial
fact that henceforward aldermen were elected for
life, and elected by their own fellows and not by the
people, it is possible that even this change, if indeed
it was a change at all, seemed less revolutionary to
the men of Nottingham in those days than it does
now, for there is no trace of any conflict concerning the
matter either at the time or for half a century afterwards.
Indeed the same method of election was used
for the councillors themselves, who also were appointed
for life.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> It appears that while the aldermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
were always selected from among the six councillors,
the councillors were chosen from “the clothing”&mdash;a
very important body composed of sheriffs and
chamberlains or treasurers who had passed out of
office, but still wore their scarlet robes on great
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>The oligarchy thus established was however no
more in absolute possession of the field than an
oligarchy of the thirteenth century. The people’s
right to hold a general assembly was admitted by the
governing class as late as 1480, and claimed by the
commonalty a century later. The jurors of the
Court Leet long acted as representatives of the
general body of burgesses for purposes of criticism
and remonstrance. For certain kinds of business
touching the community the custom of electing special
juries was maintained; as in 1458 when “twenty-four
upright and lawful men from the aforesaid town of
Nottingham, as well as twenty-four upright and
lawful men from each wapentake of the county
aforesaid”<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> were summoned to report on the state
of the bridge. It seems probable that at least six
burghers took part in the election of municipal
officers; and in 1511 the inhabitants claimed some
share in the elections by virtue of “the statute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
free elections in such cases ordained.”<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Above all the
burghers exercized their ancient rights over the
common property of the people. For in those days
Nottingham boasted of great possessions<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> in land.
From the low cliff of red sandstone which lifted it
out of the floods that constantly swamped the lower
grounds, the townsmen looked out over the common
fields and closes and Lammas lands that stretched
round it on every side, and formed until the Act of
1845 a broad belt of open country which cut off the
borough from its surrounding dependent villages, and
might in no way be used for building. These wide
reaches of pasture were yearly distributed in due
proportion among the burghers by common consent
of the mayor and the whole community. In the
division, and in questions of boundaries and fences
and fields, the commonalty were all directly interested;
and they never consented to hand over to
the undisputed management of a council rights
which touched them so nearly.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> They asserted their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
claim to attend the meetings when the lands were
divided or let out on lease, to take part in all decisions,
and to keep a close watch on the councillors
lest these should be tempted to pass over their own
names when the poor lands were divided and to
distribute among themselves all the best closes.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
At the very end of the fifteenth century their verdict
was still decisive. In 1480 the commons being
called together to the Common Hall by the mayor
on a question as to the common lands, “the said
commons would in no wise agree” to his proposal.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore probable that the charter of 1448
did not mark for Nottingham the moment of a
serious constitutional revolution. Such little evidence
as we have seems to show that the state of affairs was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
singularly like that which we have already seen in
Southampton at the same date; that things went on
pretty much as they had done for years past, and
that the burgesses neither suffered, nor thought they
suffered, any usurpation of their rights, or any grave
loss of customary liberties. The system established
in 1448 had been in full working for over half a
century before any struggle, so far as we know, took
place between the governing class and the people; and
even then it was not suggested that the disturbance
was caused by any change in the legal form of
government.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> For in 1500 Nottingham was in as
sorry a plight as Norwich had been in 1300. It was
practically handed over to the rule of publicans and
licensed victuallers, who, with or without the law,
held their own bravely against all opposition. When
brewers and bakers and vintners rose to power they
took care that the assize of bread and beer and wine
should not be brought to mind; when butchers and
cattle-dealers became aldermen and chamberlains they
encouraged a confusion which was most profitable to
themselves as to the limits of the common pastures,
letting gates and bridges fall into ruin, and “although
they have been often required by the whole community
of the whole town of Nottingham to make common
boundary marks, as their predecessors had done, have
hitherto refused to do so;”<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> even as common trespassers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
they put their cattle and sheep in the meadow
in the night time unto the great harm of their neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
The officers appointed by the council dutifully
served the interests of their masters: “We often
complain of his demeanour, and have no remedy”<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
is the comment of the Mickletorn jury about the
common serjeant. Year after year the protests of
the commonalty were heard at the local courts.
Jurors of the quarter sessions laid their grievances
before the justices of the peace, themselves the main
offenders; while the jury of the Mickletorn or Leet
asserted their right to address the town council
(when they could be persuaded to take their places
at the court) and “in the name of the burgesses and
commonalty of this town,” to declare the wrongs of
the people.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>It was in 1511 that the struggle between rulers and
burghers culminated. In the August of that year the
council seems to have violated the ancient custom,
and leased common pastures by the authority of “the
mayor and burgesses,” the witnesses being six aldermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and six of the common council<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>&mdash;a style which
had not been used before in dealing with these lands.
This meddling with the rights of the community
apparently heralded an outbreak of revolt. At the
next Court Leet, in October, 1511, the Mickletorn
jury presented the mayor who had been in power
when the lease was granted, and charged him with
encroaching on the common lands, and making his
servants “riotously break off our common pasture
hedges; it is thought contrary to right and to the
common weal.” Six months later, in April, 1512, the
jury extended their attack, and the actual “Master
Mayor” was presented for being the first beginner of
a muck-hill, for misusing the time of the common
serjeant, and for selling unfit herrings in the market
and excluding other men who would have brought as
good stuff and sold eight for a penny where he sold
five, though as clerk of the market he should have
increased and bettered it instead of impairing it, “and
upon this runneth a great slander in the country and
a great complaint.” He was charged, along with “all
his brethren,” with failing to account for money in his
charge “to the great hurt of the town and commons.”
Further the mayor and chamberlains together were
presented for not repairing the two gates of the town;
and the chamberlains for not looking after a public
well; and the mayor’s clerk, “the which takes our
wages not as a beneficial servant unto us in no matter
that any burgess of this town hath to do, but he repugnes
and maligns against the burgesses and commons
that they be not content with his demeanour.”<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>The commons went further than this, however, and
raised the question of their ancient rights of assembling
in the common hall and taking part in the
election of officers.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> At this point the authorities
became genuinely alarmed. A month later, May 21,
the Recorder or legal adviser of the corporation wrote
a formal letter of advice to the governing body on
these crucial matters of election and assembly. “I
am informed,” he says, “that divers of the commons
of your town confederate themselves together and
make sinister labour to do others to take their part
and say as they do, and intend thereby to make
aldermen and other officers at their pleasure; and
if that should be suffered it should be contrary
to all good politic order and rule, and in conclusion
to the destruction of the town. Wherefore
now at the beginning wisely withstand the same and
call your brethren and the council together, and if ye
by your wisdom think that by calling of these confederates
every of them severally before you ye
cannot order them without further help, then my
advice is that ye send some wise person to Mr.
Treasurer<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> that it would please him to see reformation,
if he be in England, and else that he would write to
my Lord Privy Seal, or to my Lord Steward, now in
his absence to see this matter redressed, ascertaining
you have spoke with my Lord Steward in this matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and he gave me advice thus to write to you; for if
ye shall suffer the commons to rule and follow their
appetite and desire, farewell all good order. For if
they be suffered now they will wait to do in like case
hereafter.” In a postscript he adds, “In any wise
beware of calling of any common hall at the request
of any one of them that make this confederacy. I
doubt not but divers of you remember the saying of
Mr. Treasurer of the inconveniences that had ensued
upon the calling of the commons together in the city
of London and in other cities and boroughs.”<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> The
sympathies of Mr. Treasurer were duly enlisted, according
to the Recorder’s advice, and on the very
day when a new mayor took the place of the
last, he wrote urging him to stand firm against those
commons who would “combine themselves to subvert
the good rule of the town and would make aldermen
and put them out at their pleasure, contrary to the
good order of your charter and privilege of your
town.” He begs them, if there be any of such “wilful
disposition to subvert the good rule of the same your
said town, that with all diligence certify me of their
names, and I trust to see such remedy for them as
shall not be to their contentment, but I shall see
them shewn condign punishment as they have or
shall deserve.”<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>The shibboleth of “good order” had its accustomed
effect, and the governing body carried their
point, though in leases of the common lands they
presently returned to the old style.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> The new mayor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
John Rose, known to the people as the butcher chamberlain
who in 1500 had let their landmarks be
removed, and who since then had grown into innkeeper
and victualler, ruled for eighteen months.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> His
successor, appointed in January, 1515,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> was Master
Thomas Mellers, an alderman who had a very bad
reputation in the presentments of the Court Leet;
after he had reigned two years, a mercer of Nottingham
tried to kill him with a dagger while he
was joyfully dining with an alderman; but he survived
to rule again in 1522.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Again the jury returned
to the charge. In 1524 the outgoing mayor was
presented at the July sessions for not keeping the
assize of bread,<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> and in October the matter was
pressed on the attention of the newly-appointed
mayor. Two years later, however, Nottingham was
for the third time put under John Rose, who in the
interests of firm government determined to suppress
once for all the importunate presentments of the jury.
During the whole time of his mayoralty, “in the
default of the said Master Rose there was no verdict
given of the jurors sworn for the body of this
present town ... to inquire of things inquirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
afore you justices of record,” nor was the assize of
victual ever put in execution; and by this the
town had not only been greatly disordered but had
been put in danger of forfeiting its liberties and
franchises.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> The next year (1527) the jury were
again roused by the fact that three aldermen, one of
them being Rose, the last year’s mayor, had by their
united efforts filled all vacancies with victuallers;
and a formal petition was addressed to the mayor
and his brethren in the name of the whole town.
They called to remembrance the law that “No
victualler should be chosen to no such rooms as
judge of victual,” and told again the long tale of
their grievances. They declare that these elections
were illegal, “the burgesses and commonalty of the
said town not being made privy, nor thereunto
consenting, contrary to the corporation of the said
town, and also contrary to the statute of free
elections in such case ordained,” and that therefore
the whole town might be made to suffer the loss of
their liberties and franchises for non-using or misusing
the same. In the lately elected aldermen
“the want of discretion and debility of reason” was
well known to the whole town, so that the common
voice and fame of it ran through the shire; and the
jurors thought “that the most wisest and discreetest
men ought to have been chosen to such rooms by
you and the burgesses <i>and commonalty</i>.”</p>

<p>Further the jury, “in their most humble manner,”
observed that the king had been deceived in the
matter of the last subsidy; for in addition to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
other crimes the three aldermen, when their substance
was assessed for a subsidy at £50 or £55, had
“embezzled” the record, and changed the figures to
a nought.</p>

<p>Finally they pray “by the whole minds and
agreements” that the present counsel of the town
might use and continue in his place “like as he
unto the same was elect and sworn, and that according
to right and good conscience he may have his
fees that is behind to him contented and paid.”<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>
All this the jury spoke in the name of the people,
“whereunto we, the aforesaid jurors, in the name
of the burgesses and commonalty of this town and
borough are fully content and agreed.”</p>

<p>In these troubles, it does not seem that the revolt
of the people was excited by any definite constitutional
change, nor was the charter of 1448 called in
question or brought forward as the origin of later
evils, nor was any protest made against the election
of councillors for life. Complaints multiply against
corrupt administration of the law, or the holding of
office by unfit and illegal men. But the claim of the
people to a share in elections is vague and indefinite,
and neither in 1511 nor in 1527 do the commons
appeal to precedent. Opinions as to their rights are
tossed to and fro, balanced by contending winds of
doctrine. In defence of the system of close election
the council call to witness the charter and privileges
of the town; while on the other hand the commons
declare that elections are illegal if the commonalty as
well as the burgesses are not “made privy nor thereunto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
consenting.” Possibly the explanation lies in a
common tendency of practice to drift away from the
theory with which it had first kept company, and
finally to disown its old accomplice. No doubt the
commons inherited theoretically an inalienable right
to take part in elections; but it had apparently
become the practice that the people should only
exercise that right in a certain definite way through
the half-dozen representatives who attended the
elections, and not through a common gathering;
and thus the situation was one in which either side
might indefinitely urge law and custom without
ever bringing conviction to their opponents.</p>

<p>It is indeed conceivable that the true peril to
popular liberty was of a far more subtle character
than the words of any charter would suggest, and
rather grew out of developements in the unwritten constitution
of the borough, than in the written law.
Not only in elections, but in the meeting of the
general assembly, insidious changes may have been
brought about by the mere growth of common custom.
In the institution of “the Clothing” there were latent
possibilities which time alone could bring to light. For
over half a century sheriffs and chamberlains were
quietly bowed out of office, and transferred with all
their fur and finery to the brilliant company of the
liveried ex-officials to await a happy re-election. But
in due course, as its numbers multiplied, the Clothing
was made manifest to all men in its stately ranks or
“clene scarlet” as the very body-guard and sworn
defenders of the central group of high officials, the
traditional depositories of power. Surrounded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
shielded by a band of forty or fifty friends who had
already held office and might hold it again, men
dedicated to their interests and disciplined to their
methods, the mayor and his brethren were no longer
left face to face with the whole community. Under
the established custom by which any burgesses who
were present at an assembly were taken to represent
the whole body, it was evidently easy even while
outwardly observing constitutional form, to summon
to the meeting only members of the Clothing; and
the decrees of the council having been submitted to
this loyal gathering were assumed to have obtained
the assent of the commonalty. Popular control
might thus be absolutely extinguished, and that
without revolution or going beyond the letter of the
law, when a council chamber crowded with the official
class<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> replaced the assembly of the commons, and
exercized its powers simply by preserving its name.</p>

<p>The plan of forming a select committee of the
General Assembly nominated by the mayor seems to
have been a very favourite custom. In Coventry, for
example, the mayor summoned certain citizens who
were added to the twenty-four to form a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
council. Their number was perhaps at first uncertain,
for in 1444 we hear of a meeting of fifty-three,
twenty-four of the council and twenty-nine other
burgesses; but apparently from 1477 twenty-four
citizens always assembled with the twenty-four jurats
to form the common council of forty-eight. Generally,
as in Leicester or Gloucester, a fixed number of
representative citizens was summoned. A lower
chamber of this pattern evidently assured the
triumph of the oligarchy; and the idea of popular
control was perhaps more completely banished by
this narrow and formal interpretation of the common
right of meeting than by mere idle neglect of the
assembly. In Nottingham, so far as we can judge
from the few council minutes preserved during the
sixteenth century, the mayor and his brethren acted
with perfect independence of the burgesses at large,
and no longer mentioned the name of the community
even in ordinances which touched the common
lands.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>Still, however, the jury fought with indefatigable
zeal for some control over administration.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> They
never let slip a chance of reprimanding their governors.
Again and again the mayor was presented for refusing
to enforce judgment on bakers, butchers, and brewers,<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
and with his brethren was charged with innumerable
frauds on the people. Sometimes we find the jury
busied about securing a capable schoolmaster;<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
they were demanding to have the accounts laid
before them&mdash;the accounts of the bridge and the free
school and the sums raised for the burgesses of Parliament,
“and how the residue of the money is bestowed,
for our money is therein as well as yours was,
and therefore it is convenient that we know.”<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> As
Englishmen had once looked back to the times of the
good King Edward, so the men of Nottingham turned
wistfully to the golden past when the Red Book had
been the charter of their liberties, and vainly prayed
that the necessary parts of the book (doubtless the
ancient town ordinances) should as of old be read
yearly in the hearing of the burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> Clinging to
the ideal of a primitive liberty, these inveterate conservatives
robbed reform of all the terrors that attached
to what was new. What had been might safely be
again. Nor was there any tendency to riot or
disorder. All must be done in a constitutional way,
and within the limits of tradition. Towards the end
of the sixteenth century, therefore, there was a good
deal of tinkering at the municipal constitution. On
March 29 (1577) the number of councillors was
increased from six to twelve, all as before to be
chosen by the Clothing.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> The democracy had probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
very little to say to this change, for the order was
made by forty-five burgesses “being then all of the
degree of chamberlains” who seem here clearly to be
acting as though their assent to an ordinance were
equivalent to the consent of the whole community.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
Six months later, however, it occurred to the people to
make some use of the ancient custom of summoning
a jury of forty-eight from town and suburbs for
public business; and they proposed to have the
common council elected by such a jury&mdash;to which
suggestion the ruling class agreed. They further
demanded that the councillors should attend at the
Leet when the Mickletorn jury presented offences and
gave their verdicts. All this was, as they claimed, a
return to the authentic custom of former days,
“according to the Red Book as we do think.”<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> But
in November the Leet jury were still praying that
this agreement should be carried out, and there is no
evidence that they ever succeeded. In any case, two
years later, when the people once more urged their old
claim to have the accounts made public and “to
hear the end and reckoning of any subsidy when any
is,”<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> they advanced a new demand for reform yet more
radical; and suggested that all the common councillors
should be utterly abolished, leaving only the aldermen
and two coroners to form an upper chamber,
“and that the forty-eight may be joined to you to
confer in any matters for the town, as there is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
other places where their corporations are better
governed than this is,”<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> and that the same forty-eight
as representing the commons should be given a
definite share in the management of the bridge and
school.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>But all these efforts proved vain, and the Council
and Clothing continued their victorious career. As
late as 1598 the commons endeavoured to revive
the old constitution of the town and to call a general
assembly through summons by the constables of the
wards; and even collected money to institute a suit
that they might inquire into a corrupt lease of common
property by a member of the council. In the curious
account preserved of the examination and depositions
of the ringleaders in calling the assembly together
the passionate determination of the people still finds
voice, and there was at least one among them to maintain
stoutly that he did not care if he died in a good
cause.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> The beginning of the next century found
the contest slowly dragging along, the Mickletorn
jury still protesting against the negligence of the
councillors<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> and the people still discussing new
constitutions with increasing nicety of detail, and
debating the merits of two chambers of twenty-four
and forty-eight,<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> or of twenty-eight each.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Meanwhile
the twelve of the council are mentioned as
existing unchanged in 1604.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the men of Nottingham had adopted
in turn all the constitutional means of securing popular
freedom that lay in their reach. They had consistently
appealed to the old ordinances which in theory at least
endowed them with sovereign power. The Mickletorn
jury had been incessantly called on to right their
wrongs by force of law. The cumbrous machinery of the
general assembly had been dragged out in its noisy
inefficiency. The custom of summoning forty-eight
jurors for public purposes had been seized on as an
institution out of which a chamber of the commons
might be created and representative government
established. But the mediæval history of Nottingham
closes with the utter failure of schemes so industriously
cherished. Doubtless reform had tarried too long in
coming. Whether the general commercial prosperity
had drawn all activity into trading enterprise and
diverted it from politics, whether a common well-being
had tended to an acquiescent conservatism, whether
the variety of trades carried on in the town had, as
in modern Birmingham, resulted in the absence of
effective trade organization or of any strong and
commanding craft guild to serve as a centre of union,
or whether in this wealthy community buried in the
Midlands there was some lack of ready interchange
of thought and discussion with the outer world, the
fact remains that resistance to the dominion of an
oligarchy was of late and ineffectual growth, and
when it did appear it seems to have mostly lost its
energies in talk. In 1600 the men of Nottingham
were still discussing the formation of a House of
Commons to represent the will of the people&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
experiment which Norwich had tried two hundred
years before, and for which in municipal life it was
now two hundred years too late.</p>

<p>Thus in the history of civic freedom Nottingham
seems to stand midway between Southampton and
Norwich. Not only did it in the fifteenth century
closely follow Southampton in the critical dates of its
municipal history, but it is certain that its local
administration must have been a matter of no less
importance to the Crown from a military point of
view. In times of disturbance it was all-important
to the king to keep a firm hold on the Midlands and
on their central stronghold, and preserve as it were a
“buffer state” between north and south, east and
west; and we have seen how quick was the central
government to take alarm at any “confederacy” to
“subvert the good rule of the town,” and how
anxiously, as in Southampton, it interfered to protect
the select oligarchy against the “sinister labour”
of the commons. On the other hand the belief
of its people in an ideal liberty, steeped as it is
in strong emotion, is far removed from the apathy
of the Southampton burghers. In the aspirations
of its commonalty Nottingham comes nearer to
Norwich, but here there is a profound difference
not only in the conduct of the controversy between
rulers and subjects but in its final issue; and the
council of the commons which the oligarchy was able
to assemble by stealth in Nottingham has no likeness
to the lower chamber created by the middle
classes themselves in Norwich.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMON COUNCIL OF NORWICH</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we turn from the southern to the eastern
coast the first impression is that of being transported
to a new atmosphere. It is not only that the outer
forms of administration are different, for these differences,
however interesting, are but the changes rung
on a common system of local self-government. But
in the political temper, the vitality of the popular
institutions, the vigour of reform, we breathe a
bracing air unknown in the Southampton docks and
slums.</p>

<p>For the traders and artizans of the eastern coast
lived in an exhilarating clime. Across the water the
towns with which they traded were full of the
movement of a free expansive life, very different from
the political depression of the communes which the
Southampton traders knew best. It was to the
eastern coast that immigrants came flying from
tyranny and clamorous for freedom; and traders from
the eastern towns who watched in the streets of
Ghent and Bruges and Ipres and Dinant, the violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
and tumultuous life of cities where the people were
still fighting for liberty, doubtless brought back from
oversea tales of the passionate temper of independence
which swept through the manufacturing
boroughs of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>But however this may be, the towns of the east
were distinguished by an intense vitality; and
among the eastern boroughs where civic life was
keenest and most fertile in experiment, Norwich
was the pioneer in the way of freedom,&mdash;twenty
or forty years ahead of Yarmouth in time<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>&mdash;beyond
Colchester in the generosity with which the commonalty
was called to share in the work of government<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>&mdash;happier
and stronger than Lynn in having
secured the union of its people into one undivided
community for civil purposes. It is not impossible indeed
that it stands in the forefront of all the English
boroughs for the quality and value of its political experiments,
and the elaborate finish of its constitution.</p>

<p>Originally, as we have seen, four bailiffs ruled the
four great leets of the city, from 1223 to 1403.
Their mode of administration has been very minutely
described.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Each leet was for convenience’ sake
divided into sub-leets, the lesser divisions being at
first probably twelve in number and afterwards ten.
The sub-leet was itself composed of as many parishes
as grouped together would contain at least twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
tithings, and could therefore produce sufficient capital
pledges to hold a leet court. For all purposes of
business every tithing was supposed to be represented
by its own capital pledge, who was probably chosen by
the tithing men, but who, once elected, seems to have
held his post for years, perhaps for life. He lived in
the parish, perhaps in the very street of his tithing,
and was generally a man of substance, one of the
respectable middle class of the city, and occasionally
might even aspire to enter the official body. In the
whole city the number of capital pledges was probably
a hundred and sixty.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>The business of each sub-leet was taken in its turn
before the four bailiffs all sitting together in the little
thatched tolbooth that stood in the central market
place. There the capital pledges appeared to answer
for their tithings at the view of frankpledge; and
when this business was over they served as a jury for
“presenting” offences at the leet court.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Year after
year there came up the same body of comfortable
well-to-do burghers, who did their business quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
without thought of entering into any controversy
with the government, like the juries of Nottingham
and Southampton.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Whether this was the result of
summoning the pledges in small groups from one
sub-leet at a time, or due to the fact that in Norwich
the people already possessed other means of expression,
there is not as yet enough evidence from other
towns to show, but the fact is important.</p>

<p>In later records we learn what was doubtless true
in 1223 as well as in 1365, that one of the bailiffs
was chosen for each great leet; and we also have
the first account of the manner of their choosing.
A body of twenty-four men, six from each leet,
was elected by the whole community, and the twenty-four
then chose the bailiffs.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> The first mention of a
custom in fragmentary records by no means implies
its first institution, and this mode of election may
have dated from the earliest times. It also appears
that before the close of the thirteenth century
the bailiffs were assisted in judicial business by a
select body of citizens, whose share in considering
the case of offenders seems to show that they
were “present in the court as informal assessors to
the bailiffs, or, in other words, forming the court of
which the bailiffs were the sole executive;”<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and
it is possible that for other business also some of the
leading citizens were summoned to attend at assemblies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and their name affixed to deeds, separately or
collectively.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> A complaint of “the mean people of
the commonalty”<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> shows that administration and
taxation had even at that early time fallen into the
hands of a small body&mdash;the bailiffs and “the rich”;
and the “customs” of the city (which were perhaps
drawn up about 1340, but which must in many
respects contain traditional usages of an earlier date)
give us some idea who were “the rich” here spoken
of. A body of twenty-four men elected by the
community, six from each of the four great leets, is
there described as forming a court for the control
of the whole trade of the city. It appointed supervisors
over the various crafts, and received reports
of fraud in trade&mdash;charges which, if it had not
been for the intervention of the twenty-four, would
have gone to the leet juries. And the same body
of twenty-four had official supervision of the city
finances and received all accounts of the treasurers
and collectors of taxes or town money.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
in 1344, we find them exercising yet another function&mdash;“the
twenty-four in the same year elected and
ordained by the whole communitas, in the presence
of whom, or of the greater part of them, if all cannot
be present, the business of the city touching the
communitas might be enrolled.”</p>

<p>Lastly it appears that the twenty-four gradually
assumed the power of making laws for the community,
and “used this custom that they might remedy new
defaults and mischiefs arising by making new
ordinances for the common profit of the town and
the citizens and of others coming or conversant
there.”<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Apparently the assembly itself was almost
superseded, for on the plea that when assemblies
were summoned for the common good of the city
and the country, the citizens did not take the trouble
to come, to the great hindrance of public business, it
had been ordained some time before 1340 that for the
calling together of the commonalty the bailiff’s
serjeant should summon certain of the most worthy
and discreet men of each leet who were to be fined
two shillings if they failed to obey the summons.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>A council of leading citizens, though it was already
organized in this elaborate way early in the fourteenth
century, scarcely appears in records of the later
thirteenth century, and even then dimly in a vague inchoate
form. It is, however, important to notice that
from the very beginning two official styles were in use
in the city documents, which seem at no time to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
been interchangeable one with another. In the Pipe
Roll of 1255 there seems to be a distinction between
“the citizens” and “the men of Norwich”;<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and
both in this year and later, whenever the borough
has any dealings with Westminster it is “the
citizens” who ask for favours, and it is to “our
beloved citizens, they and their heirs,” or to “the
bailiffs and citizens their heirs and successors” that
grants are made throughout the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Exceptions to this form are
rare. In 1347 when Edward the Third asked for
soldiers to be furnished for the French war he
addressed himself to “the mayor, bailiffs, and the
whole community”;<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> but as there was at that time
no mayor in Norwich, the phrase was possibly that of
a new clerk brought into the War Office in a hurried
rush of business. In 1355 he sent a close letter to
the “bailiffs and commonalty” of Norwich to provide
him with a hundred and twenty armed men; and in
1371 a letter to the “bailiffs, good people, or
commons” of Norwich to fit him out a ship. In all
these cases it is obvious that the king’s claim on the
people was altogether independent of any obligations
resting on them as citizens of a chartered borough.
Very rarely did the community address the king.
In 1304 and 1307<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> the “mean people of the
commonalty of the city” asked his aid; and once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
“the commune of the town of Norwich” sent a special
petition to Parliament. The city liberties had been
forfeited into the King’s hands in 1285, and the royal
officer set over it had wrongfully distrained the
people’s goods to the value of £300;<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> but since
“the citizens” in the technical sense of a corporate
body possessing certain rights ceased to exist when the
city lost its franchise, the Norwich people had to fall
back on that which lay behind all chartered corporations&mdash;on
that out of which all other rights had
sprung; it was to “the commune of the town” that
wrong had been done, and “the commune” appealed
against it. On the other hand, whenever a question
arose as to common lands or common property the
business was always done in the name of “the
commonalty” or “the bailiffs and commonalty,” and
in such cases the style of “the citizens” was never
used.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>There seems, therefore, ground for thinking that
from first to last the Norwich burghers officially
described themselves by two distinct styles, which to
the common understanding had different meanings,
and were not used at hazard. I venture to suggest
that here and elsewhere “cives” was the term used
for the corporate body of citizens possessing chartered
rights; while “communitas” stood for the citizens in
another aspect, as the community which held property
and enjoyed privileges by immemorial custom, before
the charter of a free borough had been obtained. The
holding of common property was probably the signal
survival of customary rights, the others being gradually
merged in the privileges enjoyed by charter; and
hence it was in deeds relating to land that the
traditional form of “cives et communitas” was chiefly
preserved. In every town in England, however,
whatever might be its special constitution, we find
other rights universally claimed by the commons,
which carried an authority that their opponents never
dared in any single instance to gainsay, even when
they sought to evade it. We may, perhaps, date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
back to a distant past the claim of the whole community
to have all laws ratified by their “entire assent
and consent,” to be made privy and consenting to all
elections, to know verily how the town moneys were
raised and spent, to admit new burgesses by the common
vote of the people. These were rights which the
oligarchies constantly endeavoured to make void from
the time of Henry the Third to the time of Henry the
Eighth; yet no attempt was ever made to deny or to
revoke them. It may be that their authentic force was
derived from that obscure time of which no memory is,
when the ancient “communitas” slowly built up the
great tradition of its customary rights; and that
when the remembrance of the primitive community
had by lapse of time fallen into the background its
power was still present, and to the last the name was
one of dignity and carried with it a mandate from an
older world. No doubt, however, in the vulgar
tongue “commonalty” came to be used in a popular
sense, and sometimes with an air of obloquy or contempt,
to describe the general mass of citizens who
had the right of meeting in common assembly, as
distinguished from the official class. For by degrees
old lines of division between the ruling and the
subject classes were drawn sharper and deeper&mdash;when
government by the select few took legal form; when
a council of twenty-four sat as assessors in the courts,
audited the town accounts, controlled its trade, and
claimed to make its laws; when the assembly was
reduced to a gathering of special men called by the
bailiff’s serjeant; and when even the attendance at
the leet began to fall off as at the end of the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
century<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> its business passed more and more into the
hands of the twenty-four. Then the word “communitas”
took a new shade of meaning. Before 1378
“the citizens” had come to mean in common talk the
governing council, as opposed to the “commonalty”
who were left outside.</p>

<p>It is true that the legal privileges of the community
still remained. They had a claim on part at least of
the public property. No new burgher could be
admitted save by the act of the whole commonalty,
or of twelve of them who might be taken to represent
the entire body.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Taxes might only be assessed by
will of the whole commonalty<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> or of the greater part
of the same. Whatever might be the prevailing
habit, the twenty-four had no legal right to act in
the name of the whole people, and if the commons
refused to obey their ordinances they could not appeal
to any court of law to enforce their submission.
In the Assembly Rolls the burghers are mentioned
as sharing in the business of elections, grants
of money, and taxation.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> That they asserted their
rights in a way which seemed to the governing class
“contrarious” we gather from the fact that in 1378
“the citizens” (who in this case must certainly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
meant a very limited body) presented a petition to
Richard the Second in which they declared that of late
“many of the commonalty of the said town have been
very contrarious, and will be so still unless better
remedies and ordinances be made for good government”;
and they pray that the bailiffs and twenty-four
citizens to be elected yearly by the commonalty
may have power to make ordinances and to amend
them from time to time when necessary.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> A ship
which they had just built at the king’s orders possibly
commended their request to his judgment, and the
grant of the desired charter placed the council in a
position of absolute authority, having power to issue
ordinances without the consent of the people, and to
enforce them by appeal to the royal courts.</p>

<p>What controversies and threats of revolution
agitated the men of Norwich for the twenty-five
years that followed this great change we do not
know. The exact position of the twenty-four in the
municipal assembly is not easy to trace from the
paucity of existing documents.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The rolls which
survive might be expected to shew some sign of the
effect of the charter of 1378 by which the official
authority of the twenty-four was established. Yet
such is not the case. The description of the Assembly
both before and after remains exactly the same. A
select group of citizens attends at every meeting, and
takes the whole charge of administration. Yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
is worthy of notice that neither before nor after 1378
is any order or resolution ever attributed to the
twenty-four, though such orders are constantly
referred to the action of the “tota communitas.”
Throughout these rolls the only authorities mentioned
are the bailiffs and the commonalty.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> If it is possible
to believe, as I have suggested, that the right of
the community to give or withhold consent in legislation
was an immemorial custom which could not be
abrogated by charter, the failure of the twenty-four
to carry their point can be understood. No doubt
party feeling on both sides ran high. It became
necessary for a settlement to have a new charter; and
in 1403, probably, at the instance of the ruling class,
the city bought a fresh constitution at the heavy price
of £1,000.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> By this charter Norwich was made into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
county; the four bailiffs were replaced by a mayor
and two sheriffs, to be elected by the citizens and
commonalty; and, in confirming previous grants, the
customary phraze used in the charters of earlier centuries,
“the citizens” was replaced by “the citizens
and commonalty”&mdash;a term which is recognized in the
charter as being already in use,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> but which had not
until now been invariably employed as the official style.</p>

<p>The charter of Henry the Fourth seems to have
been in effect a confirmation of the charter given by
Richard the Second, and to have set the victorious
conclusion to the whole system of oligarchical government
expressed by the council of twenty-four. The
people were quick to appreciate the difficulty of
making use of the powers which had been attributed
to them and to perceive the tendency of the charter.
A crisis was brought about by the very first elections
held under the new constitution. The charter
ordered that the sheriffs were to be elected, not as
the old bailiffs had been by the electors of the four
Leets, but by “the citizens and commonalty.” In
the ordinary assemblies, however, made up of the
twenty-four and “others of the community,” at
which Parliament men, city treasurers, and officials,
had been chosen, the twenty-four were practically
supreme, and elections carried out in these gatherings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
were, as a matter of fact, in their hands. On March 1st,
1404, a mayor was chosen, and twelve days later two
of the bailiffs were made sheriffs (the mayor’s book
says by the “cives”).<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The altered mode of appointing
the sheriffs, as compared with the more popular
custom of electing the old bailiffs, immediately roused
the commons. An assembly was called to frame ordinances
for the new state of things, and the people
determined by their own authority to create a representative
council of the burghers at large. It was
ordered that eighty persons should be elected to
attend all assemblies and act in the name of the
people. To this council was given the right of nominating
the sheriffs; the eighty were to go apart by
themselves and name three persons, but if the commons
did not approve of their choice they had again
to retire and choose other names until their masters
were content. Then the town clerk and some of the
eighty carried the three names to the mayor and the
twenty-four “probi homines”; the mayor chose one
and the twenty-four the other.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The new council
took part in the Michaelmas elections of that same
year 1404, when the mayor was reappointed, and
two new sheriffs were chosen.</p>

<p>This settlement evidently excited violent hostility,
and in 1415 a Composition was framed to put an end
to the discords by which the city was “divided and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
dissolved and in point to have been destroyed.”<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
This document did not err on the side of any lax
notions as to the seriousness of a written constitution.
With pedantic nicety it touched almost lovingly on
the minutest details of ceremony and dress, as well
as on the greater problems that vexed the state&mdash;the
position of the twenty-four; the rights of the commons;
and the share which the two parties were to
have in appointing the officers of the city.</p>

<p>The effect of this Composition of 1415 was to create
a miniature copy of the English kingdom, a little
community governed by its three estates, the mayor,
the co-citizens of the mayor’s council, and the
commons. The twenty-four “probi homines” now
became “the twenty-four co-citizens of the mayor’s
council,” the mayor having the same authority over
them “as the mayor of London hath,”<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> and the
dignity of the municipal House of Lords was fitly
marked by their dress, a livery “furred and lined as
the estate and season of the year asketh.”<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
all it was decreed that they should no longer be a
body elected yearly but should “stand corporate
perpetually,” and even if this should accidentally not
be embodied in the charter to be asked for later,
“the citizens” declared that they could establish that
law for themselves and not by point of charter, in
virtue of the right given them in 1378, to make
such ordinances as they chose in difficult or defective
cases for which no remedy clearly existed in the city
constitution.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand the organization of the lower
chamber was made more complete, and the relative
position and authority of the two houses of the
mimic parliament were defined with punctilious
exactness. The common council was reduced from
eighty to sixty members,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> to be elected from the
four wards by all citizens “inhabiting and having
houses on their own account.” It had its Speaker,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
its own mode of procedure, its system of elaborate
etiquette in all dealings with the upper house.
Henceforth it was to take a part in legislation which
entirely annulled any claim “the citizens” might
have put forward by virtue of their charter of 1378;
for though the mayor and the twenty-four preserved
the right of proposing all new laws, “they shall
nothing do nor make that may bind or charge the city
without the assent of the commonalty.” All ordinances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
made by the upper body must therefore be
formally laid before the common council, and if it
seemed to them that the matter “needeth longer
advice and deliberation of answer, they shall ask it
and all that seemeth expedient for the city by the
common speaker of the mayor and of his council.”
If needful they could ask for “a bill of the same
matters to be delivered to them,” that they might
give their answer in the next assembly; and “the
mayor shall be beholden as ofttimes as they ask it to
grant them for to go together in an house by
themselves without any denying, and none other
with them but the common speaker, and if they
will have more to them as oft as they ask, the mayor
shall be beholden to send for them without any
withsaying. And in matters that seem to the
aforesaid sixty persons for the common council that
needeth not great nor long advice, be it lawful if
they will, to go apart by themselves or in to the floor
with their common speaker, and goodly and speedily,
without great delay to come in with their answer as
them seemeth speedful and needful to the purpose.”
Finally, in “all other points that be necessary to be
had for the welfare of the city that come not now to
mind, it is committed to the whole assembly thereupon
to ordain and make remedy by ordinance and
assent of the whole commonalty for profit of all the
city.”<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of elections, however, the general
assembly reappeared in full force. When a new
mayor was to be chosen the two councils were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
summoned to the hall; “and also all the citizens
dwellers within the same city unto the aforesaid
election shall freely come as they are beholden, and
the doors of the hall to all citizens there willing to
enter and come in shall be open and not kept,
nor none from thence forbarred nor avoided but
foreigners.” After the mayor and the twenty-four
had proclaimed the election from the bench they
withdrew to the chamber, and the whole people in
the hall then chose from among those who had
already been mayors or sheriffs two names of
“sufficient” persons, “and if that any variance
happen among the commons in the hall that it may
not clearly be known to the common speaker by no
manner of form by him unto them, for to be put or
showed, which two hath the most voices, then the
common speaker and the common clerk shall go up
to the mayor and to him shall declare the variance
of the people in the hall. And then the mayor
shall give to the common speaker in commandment
for to call together the sixty persons for the common
council of the city, or as many as there be there
into an house by themselves. Which there shall
try the aforesaid variance in the same form as it
hath been and yet is used in the city of London.”
The names were carried to the chamber by the
common clerk, the common speaker, and the recorder,
with six of the common council; the six commons
returned to the hall, leaving the three officers to
take the votes of the mayor and council, and bring
back to the commonalty the name of the elected
mayor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The election of all other municipal officers was
carefully divided between the two parties in the state.
The mayor and the twenty-four elected the common
clerk, one sheriff, one chamberlain, one treasurer,
one coroner, two keepers of the keys, two auditors,
and eight constables. The common council chose
the common speaker, a second sheriff, chamberlain,
treasurer, and coroner, two keepers of the keys, two
auditors, and eight constables. The whole assembly
appointed the common serjeant, the recorder, the
bell-man, and the ditch-keeper; they also chose the
men who were to gather in the king’s taxes, appointing
four men in each ward to assess the tax and two
to collect it. The new mayor named two sword-bearers,
of whom the assembly chose one; in the
same way the mayor nominated four persons for
serjeants, and the assembly chose two of them.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
Members of Parliament were chosen by the common
assembly.</p>

<p>Thus the commons of Norwich made their decorous
entry on the official stage, with a punctilious care to
secure their dignity and make fast their liberties by
countless ceremonial ligatures. The Composition
which vindicated their right against the oligarchy
proved, however, like the Ordinances of 1404, a hard
saying to many; and disputes between the mayor’s
council and the commonalty were so violent<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> that the
citizens appealed to Henry the Fifth in 1417 for a
charter which should make the late agreement legally
binding. The mayor’s council no doubt brought influence
to bear in high places, for their position was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
now somewhat bettered. By the charter, for which
the city had to pay over £100,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> the twenty-four, now
first called aldermen, got rid of one serious difficulty
in their way by securing the clause that they “shall
stand perpetually as they do in London,” and henceforth
the old ceremony of annual election was simply
recalled by the custom of reading out the names
every year before the wards. In the composition
it had been settled that in making “new ordinances
for the welfare of the city that come not now to
mind it is committed to the whole assembly thereon
to ordain by ordinance and assent of the whole
commonalty,”<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> but the new charter decreed that the
mayor and aldermen should have full power to
amend the laws and constitution with assent of the
sixty of the common council.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>For the rest of the century the government of the
city<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> remained of this pattern. The four great leets
which had once elected the bailiffs now became the
four wards, and were ultimately divided into twelve
small wards. Each of these was represented in the
upper council by two aldermen chosen for it by the
electors of its own great ward. Each great ward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
also elected a fixed proportion of the members of
the common council. The sheriffs held their “tourns”
for the four wards, and appointed for each ward a
jury drawn from the “men of good name and fame.”
Meanwhile the leet courts of the sub-divisions over
which the bailiffs used to preside carried on an obscure
and feeble existence, and the capital pledges which
formed the leet juries sank into insignificance<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> under
the combined usurpations of the sheriffs and the two
councils. Once when the capital pledges attempted
to secure to the small trader some advantage in
landing their goods at a staith where apparently
they escaped some city tolls, the governing body
promptly repressed their insubordination.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Evidently
the administration of the city was neither more lax
nor more popular because its governing body was
enlarged.</p>

<p>In the obscure years of conflict between 1378 and
1415 we are told nothing about the men or the
organizations of men that made the revolution. But
we know that a very important movement was going
on in Norwich itself in the growth of the craft
guilds. Long forbidden by the civic government
because of the loss to the city chest when the craftsmen
were withdrawn from the common courts, they
apparently made matters easy for themselves by
regular payment of fines, and continued to flourish.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Between 1350 and 1385<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> a number of guilds were
either founded or reconstituted so as to obtain
public recognition in the city,<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> and the one fact
that we catch sight of in their ordinances amid
the absolutely monotonous and formal recital of
religious duties, is that they were in some cases
allowed to choose their own aldermen and council,
instead of being subjected as before to the twenty-four.
The importance of this is at once evident in
the ordinances of 1404, where the guilds take a very
prominent place; and in the composition of 1415,
when they were finally sanctioned and given a
completed form.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> Not only was the power of
choosing their own officers granted to every trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
but it was decreed that “citizens of the city shall be
enrolled of what craft he be of” on pain of forfeiture
of his franchise; and that all “that shall be enfranchised
from this time forth shall be enrolled under a
craft and by assent of a craft.” Such a rule
practically made the craft-masters the judges of a
new candidate for the city privileges, for if they refused
to admit him to the guild he could never become
a burgess.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> On the other hand it was commanded
that all the members of a craft must become freemen;
foreigners were to hold shops under tribute and fine
for two years and a day, and were then forced to buy
the franchise of the city. “The master of the craft
shall come honestly to him and give him warning to
be a freeman or else spear in his shop-window.” If
he did not obey within fourteen days the master with
an officer of the mayor again visited him with his spear,
“and he so speared in, nor no other, shall not hold
his craft within house nor without.” Thus no trader
or shopkeeper could remain exempt from the dues and
charges of the city, and the whole commonalty was
placed under the police supervision of the craft masters.
The very dress of the crafts was made a matter of
strict definition; all liveries and hoods of former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
days were to be given up, and the crafts were to
wear liveries the same as those of London.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>If, however, during the years of conflict the craft
associations may have done good service to the
commonalty, they were met by a counter organization
of the merchants and upper class. It seems to have
become common after the Peasant revolt, when a new
terror was stirred as to what the poor commons might
do if left to follow their own will and appetite, for the
richer sort to unite for self-protection and the preservation
of their authority. In Norwich a Guild of S.
George was founded in 1385 as a fraternity with the
usual religious colour, and a - “going each
Monday about in the city remembering and praying
for the souls of the brethren and sisters of the said
guild that be passed to God’s mercy.”<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> At first an informal
body, consisting apparently of the wealthier and
more powerful people, both lay and ecclesiastic, of
Norwich and the surrounding country, its weakness
lay in the fact that it was “desevered by constitutions
and ordinances made within the city,” and
according to the old rule by which the formation of
any guild was forbidden, it was, in fact, an illegal
body. The governing class, however, probably enlisted
considerable sympathy at court in the negociations
for the charter of 1417; and the associates of
S. George won from Henry the Fifth in 1418 permission
to constitute themselves into a permanent society,
and received a sword of wood with a carved dragon’s
head to be carried before their alderman on S. George’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
day.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> The great people of the county and their wives
entered the order, bishops, monks and rectors, counts,
knights, and merchants&mdash;something like four hundred
of them&mdash;all men of substance who rode on horseback
to the guild assembly, where the uniform of S. George
was varied by the mayors, sheriffs, aldermen, or
masters of crafts, riding in the garments of their order.
The government of the society was put in the hands
of a very close corporation, and the alliance between
Church and State in the guild is manifested by the
association of the prior, mayor, and sheriffs of the
city in its government.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>The real danger of such a fraternity lay in the
peculiar position of Norwich, and the impossible task
of local government which had been thrown on its
burghers. Beyond the city territory lay a great
manufacturing district&mdash;a whole county studded with
villages where weaving and worsted making were
carried on in every house&mdash;and over all this district
Norwich had the supervision of the woollen trade.
The difficulties of the arrangement by which, in 1409,
at the request of the commons, the mayor, sheriffs,
and commonalty were granted the right of measuring
and sealing all worsteds made in Norwich or Norfolk,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
must have been extreme. The great employers settled
in the city who organized the country labour and
supplied cloth for the export trade were thus given a
certain judicial authority in the county; while the great
wool sellers&mdash;land-owners whose vast flocks of sheep<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>
pastured on the broad downs of undulating chalk, and
who were turning into traders on their own account&mdash;were
forced in their own interest to meddle with
Norwich politics. Besides the general commercial
questions which affected both city and county, there
must have been many a vexed question as to the tenants
who owed suit and service to the courts of their lords,
but who as artizans were subject to Norwich rule and
whose fines were swept into the Norwich treasury.
On every hand the door was thrown open to trouble.
If the Norwich corporation was to busy itself in
county affairs, the county was bound to exert some
control over the Norwich corporation, whether by
guilds of St. George, by securing office in Norwich for
sympathetic mayors, recorders, or sheriffs, by winning
the help of the Earl of Suffolk or of bishop or prior, by
choosing the Norwich members for Parliament, or if
all other means failed, by bribery and violence and
the stirring up of street factions.</p>

<p>From one point of view, therefore, the story of the
long years of strife and calamity which followed the
reformation of the Norwich constitution in 1415 is
singularly interesting. In presence of a foreign foe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
internal dissension is suppressed, and the main story
is no longer, as in Nottingham, that of a struggle
between the two classes of the community itself.
When a mayor of alien interests is imposed on Norwich
by a foreign faction he stands alone, and aldermen
and commons hold apart from him as betrayer
of the common interests. The enemies whom Norwich
had to fear came from without the community itself,
and if the story of the city remained a singularly
troubled one, the troublers of its peace were not those
of its own household. Factions of the State and factions
of the shire flung confusion into the city politics,
and the old burning question of ecclesiastical rights embittered
every local dispute.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> Norwich was befriended
by the Duke of Gloucester and had a persistent enemy
in the Earl of Suffolk, and its fortunes swung
backwards and forwards with the rise and fall of court
parties. From the day when the recorder, John Heydon,
betrayed the city into their hands, the county despots
whom we know so well in the Paston Letters, meet us
in its streets and assembly hall, ever followed by the
curses of the people. Heydon of Baconsthorpe, Esq.,
sheriff in Norwich in 1431, and recorder from 1441-3,&mdash;the
man whose putting away of his wife had
created such a scandal that the very mention of it
made him turn pale, the land-jobber, the smuggler of
wool, the exactor of bribes, the parasite of the great
lords whose support he could buy, the organizer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
outrages and murder, the audacious schemer willing
to spend two thousand pounds rather than lose the
control of the Norwich sheriff, the patron of liveried
followers, the “maintainer” in the courts of men
who defied the law, the overbearing bully whose very
presence was enough to cow the commons into
refusing to present their complaints to the king’s
judges,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>&mdash;can be pictured by every one who tracks
his tortuous ways through the letters of the Pastons.
In conjunction with Sir Thomas Tuddenham and
others he overwhelmed the city with extortions, oppressions,
and wrongs. These men “through their
great covetousness and false might oppressed all such
citizens as would not consent to make such mayors
and sheriffs as they liked,” “purposing for great lucre
to have as well the rule of the city of Norwich as
they had of the shire of Norfolk,”<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> and “trusting in
their great might and power which they had and
have in the country by the means of the stewardship
of Lancaster and other great offices and for divers
other causes that no man at that time durst make
resistance against them, knowing their great malice
and vengeance without dread of God or shame of the
world.” Even when the people sought to buy the
favour of Sir Thomas, he took their money “by
briberous extortion against all faith and conscience,”
and yet showed them no mercy.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>It is just possible that the danger to the city called
into being a fraternity to confront the society of S.
George, and that the burghers in their turn seized on
the machinery of the religious guild. We catch one
passing glimpse of a curious association known as
“Le Bachery”; which was declared by the mayor
and commons to be merely a company of citizens
who out of pure devotion kept up a light in the
chapel of the Blessed Virgin in the Fields (the
ancient place for the assembly of the people) and
from mere motives of decency had chosen a livery;
but in whose pious and decent union the hostile
fraternity saw an association fashioned to break the
power of S. George, and made haste to use against
it the old argument applied to its own youth&mdash;the
charge of being an “illegal guild.”<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>The association was founded in stormy days.
After Heydon was turned out of office by the
people for betraying their interests to the prior,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> his
friend of S. George’s guild, the mayor Wetherby, an
ally of Tuddenham and a “hater of the commons,”
led the party of the county and the priory, and till
his death fourteen years later the city knew no peace.
Four times between 1433 and 1444 its franchises were
forfeited for riot or stormy elections; twice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
common seal was violently taken out of the treasury
by aldermen and commons to prevent the sealing of
proposals rejected of the people. Wetherby forced on
the election, as his successor, of a mayor refused by
aldermen and commons. John Qwerdling, falsely
pretending to be common speaker, had carried to the
chamber a name not set down by the commons for
election; Hawk the town clerk had written down a
wrong return; Nicholas Waleys had taken bribes
enough to win him the name of “ambidexter”; the
two city serjeants had packed juries, and the gaoler
had threatened and struck the resisting commons on
the head with his mace. The mayor’s faction held
the guild hall, while the aldermen’s party retired to
a private house, and having elected another candidate,
put the offending officers out of their places, took the
common seal out of the guild hall into their own
keeping, and lest by any chance their election should
be held invalid, refused to disperse till the mayor
came down to confirm it, and called the bishop to join
them in opposition to the prior. For the moment
Wetherby yielded, but revenged himself by applying
for a commission from the king to examine into the
state of the city.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> The enraged citizens kept up the
broil till 1436, when another commission was
appointed which forced the commons to submit, to
restore the seal to its accustomed place in the
treasury, and to put back the officers they had
displaced in 1433.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>At the next election, in 1437, commissioners were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
sent by the privy council to see that all was done in
order according to the charter, and in case of riot to
seize the franchises of the city into the king’s hand;<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
and thus quiet was secured. But Norwich was not
to keep its restored franchise long. Riots and daily
disturbances “concerning their liberties” broke out
between the city and the prior;<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> in June the inhabitants
of Norwich had to appear before the Privy
Council, and in July the franchises of the city were
seized and the place committed to the custody of
John Welles, a London alderman who was made
citizen and alderman of Norwich.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> At the prayer of
the bishops of Norwich and Lincoln the liberties were
once more restored in 1439, to be as quickly lost
again.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> For Thomas Wetherby “who bare a great
hatred to the commons” watched for an opportunity
of making fresh trouble. By his counsel the abbot
of S. Bennet’s at Holm prosecuted the city in 1441
for certain mills it had built on the Wensum; and
Thomas Tuddenham, John Fray, and William Paston
(a friend of the abbot’s), judged the case at
Thetford and gave it against the the city, ordering
the commons to pay £100 damages to the abbot
and £50 to the prior. At this the assembly gathered
in great numbers, crowded to the hall, in January,
1442, and took away the common seal that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
award might not be sealed. By the influence of
the Earl of Suffolk, the abbot, and Wetherby, the
city was prosecuted for rebellion, and in spite of the
protection of the Duke of Gloucester the mayor was
ordered to appear in London, where he was fined £50
and imprisoned in the Fleet, and the liberties of the
city were again seized into the king’s hands. The
mayor being thus fast in the Fleet, Wetherby got the
common seal out of the chest, sealed the bond of
£100 to the abbot of S. Bennet’s at Holm, £50 to the
bishop, and £50 to the prior, without the knowledge
of the mayor, sheriffs, or commons; and then destroyed
the new mills.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<p>This led to fresh troubles. On the Shrove Tuesday
of 1443 the mayor and commonalty, at this time
united in the mysterious guild of “Le Bachery,”
raised an insurrection, declaring they had power
enough in the city and adjacent country to slay
Thomas Brown the bishop,<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> the abbot of Holm, and
the prior of Norwich. John Gladman, a merchant,
rode with a paper crown as king at the head of a
hundred and thirty people on horseback and on foot.
At the ringing of the city bells three thousand
citizens assembled, armed with swords, bows, arrows,
and helmets, surrounded the priory, laid guns against
it, and at last won a glorious victory, and forced the
monks to deliver up the hateful deed falsely sealed
with the common seal which bound the people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
pay 4<i>s.</i> a year to the prior and to abandon claims to
jurisdiction over certain priory lands.</p>

<p>Such a triumph was naturally followed by a fresh
visit of royal commissioners in 1444.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Wetherby and
the prior brought a long list of charges against
the mayor;<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> while the city protested that Tuddenham
and Heydon alone had made mischief out
of their peaceful show; and that Gladman had only
“made a disport with his neighbours, having his horse
trapped with tynnsoyle and other nice disguisy things,
crowned as king of Christmas,” while “before him
went each month disguised after the season required,
and Lent clad in white and red herring skins and his
horse trapped with oyster shells after him.”<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the king had his own grievance against
Norwich, for the city had unluckily brought a suit
for £100 which it had formerly lent him, and now
refused to advance any more money when he sent to
solicit it.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Once more, therefore, in 1444, its liberties
and franchises were confiscated. But now at last
troubles began to lighten. Thomas Wetherby died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
as well as the bishop who had supported him,<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>
and the new bishop, of an old Norwich family, was
for peace. In 1447 the liberties were restored, and
in 1448 the king visited the city.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Two years later
however, Heydon was again to the front, ready with
Tuddenham to spend £2,000 in buying favour in high
quarters in London, and £1,000 to secure a sheriff in
Norwich committed to his interest.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> It was suggested
that the Norwich folk, the mayor with the aldermen
and all the commons, should ride to meet the Duke of
York when he visited the city, “and all the women of
the same town be there also, and cry out on them also,
and call them extortioners, and pray my Lord that he
will do sharp executions upon them ... and let
that be done in the most lamentable wise, for Sir, but
if my Lord hear some foul tales of them, and some
hideous noise and cry, by my faith they are else like
to come to grace.”<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The commission of judges<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> finally
sent to try Heydon for felony, his defiant ride through
the town into the abbey, the rumours that he was to
bear rule once more, his mode of meeting and outwitting
or terrorising the commissioners by turns, all
these are told from day to day almost in the Paston
Letters. Finally, in 1452, Judge Yelverton arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
some kind of peace in Norwich,<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> helped possibly by
the poverty and exhaustion of the city.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> By giving
a loan to the king and a present to the queen with a
promise to befriend her in her anxieties, Norwich
got a new charter in 1452.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> In this the guild of S.
George, which seems to have been united to the
corporation about 1450, was apparently victorious.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
It was agreed that the day after the mayor left office
he should be chosen alderman of the guild, and the
common council was taken into the council of the guild.</p>

<p>For the next seventy years the citizens were occupied
by strife with the prior, which dated back to
the day when the Norwich burghers were given the
city into their hands.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> The bickerings of three centuries
ended in a compact drawn up in 1524, when questions
of jurisdiction, tolls, pasturage, water, and rights
of way were settled; and it was admitted that the
mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and commonalty might go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
to the cathedral church on feast days and occasions
of solemn processions, the mayor with sword and
maces borne before him, on condition that he claimed
no jurisdiction, while the prior and monks “of their
amiable favour shall forbear as far as they lawfully
can or may” to arrest any of the corporation or the
citizens during these great processions.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>Such stories of local wranglings might well be left
forgotten and obscure if there lay in them nothing
more than vulgar quarrels. But the political experiment
of Norwich was one of such serious purpose
and such singular quality, that even in its failure
it kindles our sympathy with men who for two hundred
and fifty years had been laboriously working out
the problem of administration. With an admirable
political sagacity they had used in turn every form of
local organization to perfect their experiment in self-government.
They had taken the principle of an
elected jury and adapted it for use in their courts,
their council chamber, and their legislative assembly.
They had turned to the problem of the general
assembly, altogether useless in its primitive and unwieldy
form, and developed out of it (taking a pattern
from London) a representative council which should
guide its deliberations and express its will. The
craft-guilds were organized, and it is possible that in
the struggle their discipline gave order and strength
to the commonalty. When the battle grew hot the
machinery of the religious guild was brought into play
on either side, and S. George measured his force with
the Virgin of the Fields. No doubt these various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
methods have no claim to originality, being frankly
copied from customs known elsewhere; nor is it in
the discovery of a new path that the merit of the
Norwich burghers lies, but in the sound political
instinct by which they steadily directed their way
into the broad track whose ultimate goal is civil
freedom, rather than the narrow road of privilege.
As we watch the growth of the house of representatives
which was established among them, an independent
deliberative assembly elected by the commons; and
compare it with the chamber of magnates at Nottingham
that by a fine mockery was supposed to typify
a gathering of the whole community; we have a just
measure given us of the value of this more liberal
experiment in municipal politics&mdash;an experiment so
early in time, so serious in conception, so strong and
orderly in execution, that it might have justified an
enduring success.</p>

<p>But in spite of all the ingenuity and sagacity and
resolution which the men of Norwich brought to
their fine attempt at ordering public life, misfortune
still waited on their steps, and from the outset the
disaster of the fifteenth century darkens and throws
long shadows. For Norwich was fighting with its
doom already proclaimed&mdash;harassed by the harsh
dry climate in which fine cloth needed for the foreign
market could not be woven; by the hurry of the new
export trade which drove masters to set up their
mills by the streams of Yorkshire and Gloucestershire,
where labour was free and cheap; by changes in
methods of making worsted which shifted the manufacture
over to the Netherlands; and by the false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
economy which to help a failing trade, made English
weavers refuse Norfolk yarn to foreign buyers&mdash;the
Norwich burghers had still to endure the last calamity
of pestilence, and the sweating sickness, which first
burst on them in 1485, filled up the tale of disaster.
Industrial difficulties alone might have been conquered.
But a more insidious danger threatened all
their liberties. By a fatal accident of position and
circumstances the city, as we have seen, had been
invaded and conquered by the county&mdash;by a society
wholly separate from it in political developement. It
had bitterly proved the truth of the extreme apprehension
with which men of the towns at that time
looked on the intrusion among them of “foreigners,”
bringing into their newly ordered civic life the feudal
traditions of the county magnates, scattering liveries
among their people, and pouring into their law courts
a commanding army of retainers&mdash;“because,” to use
their own words, “by such maintainers and protectors
a common contention might arise among us, and
horrible manslaughter be committed among us, and
the loss of the liberty or freedom of the city, to the
disinheritance of us and of our children; which God
forbid that in our days by the defeat of us should
happen or fall out in such a manner.”<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> The story of
Norwich shows that in a provincial town, as in a
greater state, a constitution framed for home uses
and needs may be shattered by the violence of
foreign affairs over which it has no power, against
which it has no arms, and for the guidance of which
it has no instructions.</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">NOTE A.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Mr. Hudson believes that in Norwich the word “citizen” at
first meant merely an enfranchised equal, being frequently
described as “par civitatis,” and that from the thirteenth
century onwards the most prominent idea which it imported was
that of a privileged trader, in which sense it is used through the
series of Leet Rolls. In one class of documents, however, at the
close of the thirteenth century, he finds it apparently restricted
to a limited body of substantial burghers, into whose hands the
management of the public business had gradually passed. In
enrolled deeds which have been examined for the years 1285-1298
a great number of persons are described merely as drapers,
tanners, fishmongers and so on, while others are mentioned as
“merchant citizen of Norwich,” or “tanner, citizen of Norwich,”
and others again are put down simply as “citizen of
Norwich.” Out of the hundred and fifty persons to whom
the words “citizen of Norwich” are applied there are fifty
who are apparently of no trade; and of the remaining
hundred, thirty-two are merchants, twenty-four drapers and
linendrapers, and the rest, about fifty, belong to a variety of
occupations, but generally to the skilled handicrafts. No smith
is mentioned as citizen, and very few among the butchers and
bakers. From these facts the general conclusion is drawn that the
word “citizen” was being gradually restricted by the most
important burghers to themselves, the lower classes of those who
held the freedom of the city being massed together as the
“communitas.” (Arch. Journ. xlvi. No. 184, 318-319.)</p>

<p>The argument, however, rests on entries made in the last years
of the thirteenth century, between 1285 and 1298, at a time
when the state of things in Norwich was exceptional. The city
rule was that every man who bought and sold in Norwich should
have “made his ingress” into the town and become of the
“franchise” or “liberty.” How often the law was evaded we
see from the presentments of the leet courts. (For the last ten
years of the thirteenth century see Town Close Evidences,
12-15.) It would seem that as the prosperity of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
increased new inhabitants had begun to flock to it who were far
more concerned in making their own bargains than in carrying
out the laws and customs of the borough; and who, especially
the poorer sort engaged in humble trades, were anxious to
escape the payments and responsibilities of citizenship. Blomefield
(iii. 73) states that about 1306, owing to difficulties in
paying the ferm, it was ordered that every one who had traded
for a year and a day in the city must take up his freedom,
paying for it a fine of 40<i>s.</i> if he were not entitled to the franchise
by birth or service. Since every citizen was bound to have a
house, building went on fast, and can be measured by the
increase of rents from houses. For “in 1329 Simon de Berford
the King’s escheator on this side Trent gave the city much
trouble concerning a number of houses, shops and tenements
lately erected by grant of the city on the waste grounds of the
said city, on pretence that all the waste belonged to the King
and not to the citizens, and that the rents of all such buildings
should belong to the Crown (Custom Book fo. 2) by which means
great part of the city rents, namely all the rents <i>de novo
incremento</i> or new increased rents, would have been lost from the
city to the value of £9 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year, by which we may
calculate the surprising increase of the inhabitants of this place
from the beginning of Edward II. to this time. The small rents
or old rents of houses erected upon the city waste from its
original to Edward the Second’s time amounted to but 9<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, so
that if we compare the new increased rents with the old ones we
shall find in about thirty years’ time nineteen times as many
houses erected upon the waste as there were before, an argument
sufficiently showing how populous it grew by its flourishing trade,
and indeed its increase continued as surprisingly till that fatal
pestilence in 1349.</p>

<p>“To remedy this imposition the citizens sent to Thomas Butt
and John Ymme, their burgesses in Parliament, then held at
Winchester, to complain of the usage to the King and Parliament;
upon which the King afterwards directed his writ to the said
Simon, certifying him, that by the grants of his progenitors,
Kings of England, the citizens held the city and all the waste
ground by fee-farm, in inheritance, and that therefore he had
nothing to do to molest them in letting out such void grounds to
be built upon for their profit and advantage towards paying their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
fee-farm. This writ bears date at Reading March 25, in the 4th
of his reign.” (Blomefield, iii. 80-1.)</p>

<p>These facts seem to indicate that citizenship was a less frequent
thing among the inhabitants of Norwich at the end of the
thirteenth century than in the first half of the fourteenth
century&mdash;and was at that time possibly confined in practice to
those who gained it by birth or service, and that purchase was
rare.</p>

<p>For the very different law made by the Bishop of Norwich in
1307 for Lynn see p. 408. He may have desired to secure for
Lynn the small traders who found themselves hard pressed by
the Norwich decree of 1306.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMON COUNCIL OF LYNN</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not in Norwich alone that the people, refusing
submission to a governing plutocracy, made
the experiment of creating a lower house of commons
to represent the burghers at large. The peculiar
difficulties that beset popular government in that
city were absent in other towns, but in no case was
the experiment a simple matter. Everywhere unforeseen
dangers were presently disclosed, dangers
new and various, and capable of overwhelming the
new movement in ultimate ruin and confusion. Even
at the moment when Norwich was forming its second
chamber, the town of Lynn, but a very few miles
away, was developing a common council wholly
different in its origin and its constitution, and
threatened by occasions of failure and betrayal of
which Norwich had no experience.</p>

<p>The case of Lynn is one of singular interest. Nowhere
else in England was there a corporation more
wealthy, or more formidable from its compact organization
and great authority. On the other hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
nowhere else perhaps was there a community of
“mean people,” burgesses and non-burgesses, so
prosperous, active, and united; sustained as they
were in every emergency by the effectual protection
of their lord the Bishop, who, in his jealousy of the
governing class, was forced to become the ally of the
subject people, and to make their cause his own.
Under these circumstances the conflict between the
commons and the plutocrats who ruled over them
had some original characteristics, and the problem of
church and state in Lynn emerges in a new and
subtle form.</p>

<p>The ruling class of the town was from the first
the governing body of the Merchant Guild.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> For
here, as in other leading ports, it is evident that the
rich traders quickly became dominant in civic affairs,
even though their association in a Guild Merchant of
itself gave them no right to govern. In Lynn a
powerful merchant class must have been formed at a
very early time. Through the town lay the one way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
by which Norfolk could be entered from the west;
and its port was the only outlet for the trade of seven
counties. Lynn was therefore the centre for the
largest cattle market in the east of England, whence
the export trade drew supplies of wool and fells and
hides;<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> its middlemen and merchants held in their
hands the commerce with Gascony, the Rhineland,
Zealand, “the parts of North Berne,” with Prussia,
and Dacia, and the Hanse towns; and as early as
1271 the German merchants had some sort of local
organization there under their alderman Symon, a
citizen of Lynn, of whom we hear that he gave a
pledge on behalf of some Lübeck merchants to the
amount of £200.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> No interest in the borough could
compete with the great commercial company<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> by
whom the whole volume of trade that was borne over
the waters of the Wash “rowing and flowing,” was
ultimately controlled. Under the name of the Holy
Trinity it had obtained a charter from John, and by
the time of Edward the Second had nearly nine
hundred names on its bede-roll. The sons of its old
members were allowed to enter the guild on payment
of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; while others, men and women, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
willing to give 60<i>s.</i> or 100<i>s.</i> to be counted among
its brethren, the men looking to share in the political
as well as commercial benefits it offered, while women
were perhaps consoled with its spiritual gains; and
men and women alike paid the same entrance fee to
be enrolled after death in consideration of the eternal
advantages of such membership.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> In 1392 the guild
employed thirteen chaplains yearly to say masses in
the churches of S. Margaret, S. Nicholas, and S.
James, used much wax for lights in churches and
chapels, and from the profits of the common staith
gave alms and fulfilled works of charity.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>The spiritual blessings of the guild, however, pale
before the financial and political boons it had to offer.
As a great trading company it heaped up wealth and
increased power. The aldermen and his brethren
made laws to regulate the commerce even of those
burgesses who did not belong to their select company,
but carried on business by virtue of the charter of
free trade granted to the whole borough.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> The guild
owned along with other property the common staith
and all its appurtenances, the quay where by its
decree “no bad persons, nor any spiritual persons
should work,”<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and the right of passage for a boat
beyond the port.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> The monopoly of various profitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
trades was secured to its members, as for instance
the sale of mill-stones,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> paving-stones, and
grave-stones which were sold at from 20<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i>
apiece. The brethren of the guild were the bankers
and capitalists of the town.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> They lent money out
on usury, and not only did the corporation come to
borrow from their treasury, but in 1408 more
than fifty townsmen were in their debt for sums
varying from £1 to £119. The trading activity of
the company may be measured by the fact that in
1392 the guild had in ready money £60 13<i>s.</i>, and
in divers merchandise £200;<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> and in 1408 the loans
came to £1,214. In 1422 its wealth was £1,403, of
which the debts due to it made up £1,210. Its
expenditure was generous and magnificent. Large
sums were spent on the new guild hall, beginning in
1422 with £132 4<i>s.</i> The silver plate in its treasury
weighed in the first half of the century 440 ounces.
A silver wand was borne before its dean; and its
members were carried to their graves under a covering
of cloth of gold.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Financial transactions on such a scale as this would
in any case have given the guild control over a town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
government whose expenses were fast increasing, and
which in every time of need turned to its coffers for
money. But the company of the Holy Trinity exerted
far more than an indirect authority over the
corporation. It was in effect itself the real governing
force in Lynn. By a charter of Henry the Third its
alderman (who held office for life and was thus absolutely
independent of popular control) was joined
with the mayor in the rule and government of the
borough: in case of the mayor’s absence or death he
was appointed in his stead,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> and in the election of a
new mayor he took the leading part.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Moreover, the
twenty-four jurats of the council, who had the control
of all town business, and from among whom alone
the mayor might be chosen, were bound to be brethren
of the guild. Under these conditions the “Potentiores”&mdash;the
“great men of the town”&mdash;as they were
commonly called in the time of Edward the First,
ruled without restraint, and with a high hand
assessed taxes, diverted money from the common
treasury, profited by illegal trading, used customs
contrary to common or merchant law, and bought the
king’s forgiveness if any complaint was made of their
crimes. Against their despotism there was no
protection for the burgesses of humbler station&mdash;the
middle class which went by the name of Mediocres,
and the yet lower layer of the people known as the
Inferiores, traders and householders who were not
burgesses, and whose prosperity, if fairly well established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
was of a less brilliant character than that of
the upper classes.</p>

<p>There was, however, a disturbing element in the
history of the Lynn corporation which was absent in
Southampton, Nottingham, or Norwich. The lord of
the manor was close at hand, and the governing class
had to reckon with his claims and expect his interference.
Local disputes magnified his power. Thrown
together as natural allies against the potentiores, the
mediocres and inferiores were forced to rely mainly
on the protection of the Bishop. He on his part,
whether for the sake of developing the trade of his
borough, or for the sake of increasing the population
dependent on himself rather than on the rival power
of the mayor, stipulated&mdash;and this at the very
moment when Norwich was compelling all its traders
and artizans to buy its freedom&mdash;that the mayor
should not have power to force the franchise on any
settlers old or new who might take up house in the
town while preferring to remain free of the charges of
citizenship. He won from the mayor, moreover, in
1309, a Composition for the protection of both
mediocres and inferiores, which not only became the
charter of all their future liberties, but was also the
fullest recognition of his own authority.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> From this
time, in spite of efforts on the part of the municipality
to evade the composition, the mean people, confident
of their legal position and assured of the support of
a powerful patron, formed a society differently compacted
from that which we find in other boroughs,
and played a part in the politics of Lynn which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
perhaps unique in town history. The “community”
of Lynn differed from the “community” of other
boroughs in being made up, as is formally stated in
1412, not only of burgesses, both potentiores and
mediocres, but also of inferiores<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> or non-burgesses.</p>

<p>The first detailed account of the constitution of
Lynn is given in Letters Patent of Henry the Fifth
in 1417, where the “ancient custom” which ruled
the town was recapitulated.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> When a mayor was to
be elected the alderman of the guild appointed
four “worthy and sufficient” burgesses, who added
to themselves eight comburgesses, and this jury of
twelve elected one of the twenty-four jurats as mayor,
and appointed the other municipal officers for the
coming year.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> The council of twenty-four jurats,
which was drawn wholly from the ranks of the
merchant guild and elected for life, filled up its own
vacancies, so that when any one of them died or
resigned his office or was expelled, the townsfolk
appeared as mere spectators in the hall, while the
mayor and remaining jurats chose “one of the more
worthy, honest, discreet, and sufficient” of the
burgesses to fill the vacant place. If it became
necessary to elect any other officers the mayor
nominated four comburgesses, who named in their
turn eight others to form a jury.</p>

<p>In later days it was supposed that so long as these
ordinances were observed “mayor, jurats, burgesses,
and community, rested happily under the sweetness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
of peace and quiet throughout the days of prosperous
times.”<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> Prosperous times there had certainly been<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
if we judge by the growth of the town’s budget. In
1354 the corporation spent £176; in 1355 £94; in
1356 £266; in 1357 £92; in 1367 £165; in 1371
£163; in 1374 £249. The year 1377 was very
costly to the burghers, whose expenses suddenly
mounted to £874. It was the year of the quarrel
with the Bishop of Norwich,<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> and Lynn had to give
£318 15<i>s.</i> to the king, his mother, and others
“labouring for the community” when the Bishop
laid his complaint before the council “for a certain
transgression done to him in the town”; and to
pay £116 10<i>s.</i> for the expenses of the mayor,
aldermen, and burgesses who went to London on the
same business. They were required further this year
to spend £113 on making an enclosure for the defence
of the town; and £103 10<i>s.</i> on a town barge,
doubtless fitted out at the king’s demand to serve as
a war vessel. All this naturally ended in a heavy
debt; the corporation had only been able to raise
£650 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> and had to borrow £160 from the
guild, and to leave the salaries of the mayor, clerk,
serjeants, and chamberlains unpaid. The next year,
however, it made an effort to clear off its debt and
actually spent nearly £773, paying off £241 10<i>s.</i>
to its creditors. From this time expenditure grew
fast. In 1380 it was £351, and in 1382 £204; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
1385 £304; in 1389 £394; in 1399 £461.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> In 1403
the borough had to lend to the king over £333 which
was not repaid till 1425.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p>The municipal debt of course grew as fast as the
municipal expenditure, and in 1408 the corporation
owed the guild between £400 and £500.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The council
of jurats borrowed generously from the fraternity
in their capacity of town councillors, and lent
as generously to the corporation in their capacity of
members of the guild. The inevitable abuses which
belong to financial administration conducted on this
system presently made themselves felt. Perhaps there
was an attempt at reform when in 1402 changes were
made in the manner of keeping and auditing accounts,
and each of the four chamberlains had to return a
separate statement of receipts and outgoings.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> But
if so the remedy was ineffectual, and for the state
of Lynn, as for far bigger states, the question of
finance ended in a question of revolution, or was at
last the pretext of revolution. The angry discontent
of the community finally broke out in 1411, when
the people demanded the repayment into the town
treasury of a sum of £458, which the last five mayors
had spent without the consent of the community in
litigation with the Bishop, to the serious prejudice
and extreme depoverishment of the town. The five
mayors on their side, at the head of the potentiores,
retorted by claiming from the town £280 to repay
losses which they had incurred in its service during
their terms of office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the traditional “sweetness of peace” was at
an end, and Lynn was presently plunged into the
excitement of a revolution. Fortunately for the
people the ruling body found itself face to face with
all its enemies at once; for the mediocres and
inferiores, alike excluded from places of honour and
power, were as of old drawn into close relations
and were together thrown on the protection of
their lord the Bishop for the defence of their
rights; while the Bishop himself, with whom the
municipality had been dragging on a long quarrel
for the last thirteen years, was probably in no conciliatory
mood. Everything, however, was conducted
on strictly constitutional lines. By common consent
a committee of eighteen men of the town was appointed
to deal with the grievances of the state, and
every section of the town society was required to
give pledges of obedience to its decision. The
mayor and twenty-two potentiores bound themselves
in sums of £100 each to submit to the decrees of the
eighteen; eighty-four of the mediocres pledged themselves
in sums of £50 each; and sixty-six of the
inferiores in sums of £5 11<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> On the committee
itself each of the three classes that made up the
community was represented. There were twelve
burgesses, of whom seven were potentiores and five
mediocres, and six non-burgesses or inferiores.</p>

<p>At first all seemed to go well for the popular party.
The decisions of the committee were eminently
satisfactory. The compensation money which the
late mayors had claimed was altogether refused; and
they were ordered to repay to the town treasury the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
£458 illegally spent without consent of the community.
A decree was made that henceforth the
mayor should only have, according to ancient custom,
£10 for his year’s fee and whatever the community
might put by for his reward having regard to his
merit or demerit; and that he should answer to the
town for all arrears of contributions during his
mayoralty. It was declared that the non-burgesses
had been deprived of the privileges secured to them
by the composition of 1309, and an order was made
that from this time they “shall have and use all
rights to the said inferiores granted.” This was a
declaration of ancient law and custom; but the
committee went further and began the process of
“mending the constitution” by issuing a decree that
for the future each mayor should choose and take to
himself a council consisting of three potentiores,
three mediocres, and three inferiores, which nine
persons together with the mayor should have full
power to deal with the rents, etc., of the community.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>
By these ordinances which mark the triumph of the
alliance between the mediocres and inferiores with the
lord of the manor behind them, just as the composition
of 1309 had marked their triumph a century
before, the non-burgesses were formally given a share
in the actual control of administration&mdash;a circumstance
which so far as published records go has no parallel
in the history of any other borough. The decrees
were agreed to (how reluctantly was to be proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
later) by the corporation on April 8, 1411, and
signed by persons chosen from the three orders of
inhabitants;<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> in November, 1412, they were confirmed
by Henry the Fourth; and once more on April 10,
1413, by Henry the Fifth.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, in 1411, the important question
of elections was raised; and for the sake of securing
to the commonalty a due share of power along with
the alderman and his brethren, it was suggested that
“certain new ordinances and constitutions concerning
and about the elections of the mayor and the rest of
the jurats, and officers, and ministers,” might be drawn
up. The commons were to meet together a week
before the day of election, and choose from among
themselves a common speaker&mdash;a prolocutor he was
called in Lynn. All burgesses who desired it might
freely come to the guild hall for the election, and
the congregation having been made, after public
proclamation that none but a burgess or minister
might give his vote,<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> they should choose two names
from among the jurats, and from these two names
the mayor and jurats were to select one as mayor.
Throughout this proceeding the prolocutor and clerk
were practically set to act as spies<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> on one another in
the interests of their several parties, the prolocutor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
guarding the people’s interest, and keeping watch at
the elbow of the common clerk (the nominee of the
mayor and jurats) as he went from burgess to burgess
in the hall to inquire for whom they wished to vote,
or as he carried the nominations to the mayor, and
wrote down the decisive votes of the upper chamber
“severally and secretly.” In like manner the
election of the other officers was also regulated;<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> and
above all, the burgesses were, for the first time, given
a share in the election of the council of twenty-four,
being allowed at every vacancy to nominate two candidates;
if these were rejected they were again to
choose two other names, and so on until the jurats
were satisfied. In its new constitution Lynn, like
Norwich, decided to shape its system after “the
manner and form in which it was used in the city of
London;” but in Lynn there were special difficulties,
and the new scheme could only be brought “at least
to the greatest possible conformity with them of
London, forsomuch that in the aforesaid town there
are not had aldermen, wards, recorder, nor divers
other things as in the city of London.”<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Unhappily for “the sweetness of peace” parties
were so evenly matched in the committee of eighteen
that the reforms were only passed by a majority of
one vote.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> Moreover, the agreement&mdash;drawn up by
the committee on April 8, 1411, set forth and
assented to by the mayor and community in May,
signed by their orders in July, and sealed with the
common seal in December&mdash;was not confirmed by
charter till the following November, 1412.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Thus,
when the burgesses met on August 27, 1411, to
choose a new mayor, their ordinances were still but a
common agreement and without any sanction of law
if they were disputed. Burgesses and non-burgesses
gathered in force, some three hundred or so strong,
to see what was going to happen. The question
was raised as to what form of election should be
used, and a proposal was made to delay the business.
But the mayor having put it to the meeting that
all who wished to proceed with the election were to
sit down and the others to rise up, all save six
“suddenly as in a moment fell on the forms, benches,
and ground”; and a hundred and forty-eight burgesses
insisted on going on with the business. The
next point was how the electing jury was to be
named, and the hundred non-burgesses present begged
to have “a little voice” in the matter, which was
refused. The alderman of the guild and the inferiores
having been thus set aside, the burgesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
were left in possession of the field, and they
proceeded, with a compromise between the old
and new systems, to nominate, as the alderman had
formerly done, the first four members of the jury,
two jurats and two mediocres, who then added to
themselves eight burgesses. In the following year
the people again assembled, burgesses and non-burgesses
together to the number of three hundred,
in spite of a notice on the rolls of process for
“quieting these dissensions,” and again carried out
the elections after the new mode.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>The balance of forces, however, was too even to
give the victors any security of tenure, and government
worked with great friction. It seems that the
mayor of the popular party strengthened the radical
vote by admitting to the franchise “foreign” inhabitants
(probably some of the inferiores) against
the will of the council; while the reformers insulted
the guild brethren in their own guild hall; and in
1415 “without consent of the mayor and burgesses”
quit-claimed the debts of the town&mdash;debts owed, as
we have seen, to the guild.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> By their enemies the
new ordinances were declared to have “furnished the
fuel of grief and hatred,” and according to the
malcontents the late agreement had only caused
“immense expenses, charges, losses, and intolerable
damage by reason of discords, strifes, and other ills,”
and must inevitably “redound to the final destruction
and pauperization, but also the desolation and
probable overthrowing of all that town.” In 1416
an appeal was made to Henry the Fifth, whose sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
here, as in Norwich at the same time, was with
the oligarchy; and he summoning the parties before
him<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> ordered a final concord between them. To
“pluck up by the roots and extirpate strifes” the new
ordinances were utterly annulled, the former customs
of the town recapitulated, and the old constitution
restored. The alderman received again his ancient
position,<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> the jurats became once more a self-electing
body, and the town was subjected to the system dear
to the potentiores, and against which the people had
risen in vain. From this time the old method of
election was resumed and carried on throughout the
century.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Murmurs of discontent still seem to have
been heard occasionally. In 1419 one of the townsmen
challenged the alderman of the guild at the
election assembly. “We would know,” he said, “by
what authority or right you call up four persons to
make our mayor”; but he was put down by a speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
about “our charter,” and after this meeting it would
seem that the public were no longer admitted to the
meetings of the corporation.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>Defeated on the great issue of the election of the
mayor and jurats, the commons fell back on the idea
of a chamber of representatives. An attempt had
already been made, in 1411, to form a council of nine,
which though appointed by the mayor was to be
drawn from the three orders of the community, and
to act for them; but this scheme came to an end
with the annulling of the ordinances. No sooner,
however, was the old power of the potentiores
restored by Henry the Fifth than the idea of a common
council immediately revived among the people,
possibly inspired by the example of Norwich which
had only a year before secured the charter that gave
its common council a permanent status. It was
decided that each of the nine constabularies or wards
in Lynn should choose three burgesses “having
sufficient tenure in the town” who should take part in
all business concerning taxes, tenths, fifteenths, allowances,
repairs of houses, walls, bridges, water-courses,
ditches, all payments, rendering of accounts, and
other charges of the borough. This new body of
twenty-seven became at once generally known as the
common council, and was formally confirmed by the
Bishop in 1420. The community bound itself to obey
any decree which was issued in the name of the two
councils,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> and from December, 1418, when the noble
jurats and the discreet burgesses met for the first
time in the guild hall, the whole conduct of town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
business passed into their hands.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> Henceforth decrees
and ordinances were made with the assent of “the
whole congregation”;<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> but it is obvious that the institution
of the common council in this form marked
the final separation between the interests of the two
lower classes of the community, and the irrevocable
close of their alliance. As in 1411 the inferiores had
been declared incapable of any share in electing
officers, so now they remained without any part in
legislation, while the mediocres entered happily into
their inheritance.</p>

<p>So the revolution of Lynn flickered out. For the
new common council cannot be said to have represented
after all a very formidable concession to
democratic demands. Unlike the council of 1411 it
apparently took no account at all of the inferiores.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
The electorates of the constabularies seldom numbered
more than twenty people and sometimes as
few as twelve, and the whole body which elected the
new council did not consist of more than a hundred
and fifty persons.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> To prevent any trouble, moreover,
there was a provision that if any man proved unfit,
the mayor and aldermen and the councils of twenty-four
and twenty-seven might choose another in his
place.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> With such safeguards the new representatives
might be trusted to work in complete harmony with
the older body; the potentiores had taken the
mediocres into their counsels and formed an alliance
with them, and the inferiores, left outside the door of
the common hall, deserted by their old confederates,
and dependent on a lord whose influence was steadily
on the decline, sank into obscurity and silence. In
course of time the jurats rose to the full dignity of
an upper house, and effectually secured in their own
hands the whole administration of the nine constabularies
by an order (in 1480) that a jurat must be
chosen as alderman in each constabulary, that the
alderman and constable together shall keep the peace
and settle debates, and that if they could not reduce
rebellious persons to quiet, no burgess in that constabulary
might be suitor in any court, spiritual or temporal,
without the leave of the mayor.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Finally, in 1524,
the two ruling classes obtained a charter which
formed their corporation into a close self-elective
body; the mayor was to be elected by the twelve
aldermen, and the twelve aldermen by the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
council, and the common council by the mayor and
aldermen.</p>

<p>In the last state of the council we see the strength
given to the upper classes by a common alliance, by
the humiliation of the non-burgesses, and by the
increasing weakness of the lord of the manor. It
would, however, be impossible to maintain that in
Lynn a primitive democratic government had been
gradually submerged by a usurping oligarchy. If we
compare the demands put forward in 1309 by the
inhabitants at large&mdash;demands for freedom of trade
and some assurance that they should not be unjustly
taxed&mdash;with their claims a century later to be
formally represented in the administration of the
town, we see what strides had been made in that
hundred years in the notion of popular government;
and so far as it was not violently thwarted by alien
influences the movement of the early fifteenth century
was in the direction of widening liberty. In the
new governing body more than twice as many members
sat as in the old council of the potentiores, and
two orders of the community were represented instead
of one; while the commonalty lost none of the ancient
customary rights which had originally belonged to it.
The non-burgesses still made their appearance with
the rest when taxes were to be levied or the common
property allotted. In 1435, when the mayor was
sent to Bruges as one of the king’s ambassadors on
commercial matters, his journey and its expenses
are ordered “by the full advice and assent of the
twenty-four and the common council and of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
burgesses and merchants of Lynn.”<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> During the
first years of Henry the Sixth loans of money to the
king and the receiving of re-payments was done in
the name of and with the consent of the whole community;<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
in 1448 arbitrators to decide on a disputed
question about a tenement were in like manner
elected by the whole community;<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> and in the levying
of taxes the whole three orders acted together
as of old, so that in 1463, when a sum of £36 had
to be raised, of the eighteen men chosen to assess the
tax, six belonged to the jurats, six to the common
council, and six to the “communitas.”<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>Still, however, from the point of view of any real
extension of liberty, the revolution had failed, and
as in Norwich it had failed from purely external causes.
The temporal sovereignty of the Church had destroyed
the political freedom of the State. From the time
when the Bishop had broken their society into two
sections, which could never again unite for civil
purposes, an ecclesiastical tradition stood between
the people and freedom. The crucial moment for
liberty in Lynn had occurred a century before, on
that day in 1309 when the Bishop had won from the
corporation the right to create as a bulwark of his
power a class of inhabitants protected in every
material interest of their lives, but cut off from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
body of free citizens, and carefully debarred from
political independence. For a time the system by
which a privileged class was allowed to buy the
protection of the borough without paying the fair
price, and to maintain a position within its walls
by the authority of a power without, seemed to work
well for both parties to the cunning bargain&mdash;indeed,
to offer certain advantages. Dependent on the
Bishop for all their rights of trade and privileges, the
inferiores were content to let him fight their battles,
which he did so effectually that the mediocres themselves
were attracted to their party, and made common
cause with them to the apparent profit of all
concerned. But the only strength of a corrupt
alliance utterly false in principle lay in the support
given by the Bishop, and no sooner did this begin
to fail than the whole scheme utterly collapsed. The
question of elections raised at the August meeting
of 1411 gave the potentiores their opportunity to
break up the confederation from within by detaching
the hundred or hundred and fifty mediocres from
the rest of the party of resistance, leaving the non-burgesses
to shift for themselves; and when these,
suddenly alive to their hapless situation, tried to recover
ground and begged to be taken into the family
of citizen-voters, even by “a little voice,” there was
no place found for their repentance. The common
council which the community had striven to create
finally represented only a handful of privileged people
instead of the general body of inhabitants, and any
hope of the political developement of Lynn as a free
community was once for all arrested. The betrayal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of the common cause of civic equality brought its
exact recompense on the day when every weapon
of the unenfranchised inhabitants was seen to be
broken and useless. In the common assembly they
had no votes. In the common council they had no
representatives. The machinery of all their seventy-five
guilds<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> could not in any way be so handled as
to further the power of the people; for so long as
the great body of craft-holders and artizans lay
outside the borough franchise it was impossible for
them to employ their organizations in the service
of the common cause. Deprived of the close connection
between the borough and the craft which
existed in other towns, they could neither aspire to
send delegates from the trades into the council
chamber, nor could they make the crafts the only
way of entrance into the freedom of the city.</p>

<p>The main result of this breaking up of the “communitas”
of Lynn into three fractions which could
never again be united, was the final affirmation of
power in the hands of a small ruling class. In
Lynn it was always the merchants who conquered.
One by one they vanquished their opponents, the
Church, the mediocres, the inferiores. A singular
and pathetic unity pervades the history of the town
from first to last. Lynn had won from land and sea
a little space of ground, a little tenure of life, and
there, lighted by a passing gleam of beneficent
fortune, it made its brief experiment&mdash;a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
experience consistent from first to last, and scarcely
subjected to accident or change. The old borough
still retains some subtle charm of a lingering distinction.
Even now as we look at the homes of its
last traders&mdash;the heavy double doors which shut off
the great court from the street, the houses built
round three sides of the open square, and lifted at
the back straight out of the waters of canals cut to
give passage to the ships and barges which drifted
up on every rising tide, almost brushing as they
passed the windows that opened on rich chambers
dark with carved work in wood&mdash;we seem to breath
the strange air of a remote place and time in which
this old city of dead merchants lies ever steeped.
The very fashion of the place still affirms perpetually
that when the end came the ancient rulers of Lynn
made a proud exit, bequeathing their heritage to
none, and leaving their silent dwellings to suffer indeed
the presence of strangers, but with no pretence
of acquiescing welcome.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMON COUNCIL OF SANDWICH</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attempt in various boroughs to create a municipal
house of commons for the protection of popular
liberties is so striking a fact in the town history
of the fifteenth century that, for the sake of again
observing the experiment under a new set of conditions,
we may take one last example of the building
up of a representative council. The case of
Sandwich differs considerably from that either of
Norwich or of Lynn, though one significant fact is
common to all three boroughs. In each of these
towns the effort to work out the new constitution
was frustrated; and, singularly enough, it was frustrated
in every case, not by any evidence of inherent
weakness in the scheme itself, but by the operation
of external and accidental causes. In Norwich the
system was possibly wrecked by difficulties in the
working of what we may call foreign affairs&mdash;that is
by the ill-defined and impossible relations of the
town to the country, when the town claimed to interfere
with interests over which its authority was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
limited, while these interests had no regular representation
in its councils, so that intrigue came in to
replace recognized and orderly influence, and the
natural distinctions of parties within the town were
submerged in factions more or less external and
artificial, and in the corrupt political ambitions to
which these gave opportunity. In Lynn an equally
artificial state of parties was created and maintained
by the miniature strife between the Church as a
temporal power and the civil government. The
existence of a large body of commons delivered by
the Bishop from taking up the just burdens of
citizenship, as dependents on his protection, withdrawn
from a full share in the responsibilities of
their fellow-townsmen and used as a sort of occupying
army for the maintenance of his rights over the
borough, was fatal to the healthy developement of
municipal self-government. But in Sandwich an
altogether new problem is suggested&mdash;the problem
of local self-government in the members of a confederated
state, in which the several communities
might tend towards democracy while the central
administration remained the stronghold of aristocratic
tradition.</p>

<p>For Sandwich must not be considered as if it stood
alone like Norwich, independent and self-contained.
Under the constitution of the Cinque Ports, as we
have seen, certain weighty matters, such as military
defence, finance, foreign trade and foreign traders, the
higher matters of justice, and so on, were under a
central government represented either at Dover or
at the Brodhull, and the several towns were mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
concerned with local affairs. It is possible that in
the conduct of daily business of a comparatively
simple kind there was less necessity than in the
greater boroughs for the supremacy of experts, and
apparently administration did not so soon harden
into the despotism of an oligarchy. There was much,
moreover, which was favourable to popular movements
in the general conditions of Kent and Sussex,
which, even as early as the twelfth century, were
centres of important mining and manufacturing industries,
and in whose midst there arose more than
once movements of liberal and radical thought like
those which in our days have come from the coal-fields
and iron mines of the north. The trading
vessels which put out from the ports across the
German Ocean kept the people in constant touch
with the commercial towns of the north European
coast where municipal life was most vigorous and
enduring. And of the strangers to whom Sandwich
gave shelter, till at last almost a third of its streets
were occupied by foreigners, the main body were
traders or artizans from the Netherlands who,
wherever they sought refuge after their desperate
battle against oligarchy in their own country, must
have carried with them their sturdy creed of independence
and freedom of political discussion, and would
have inevitably ranged themselves on the popular
side of town politics, whether as enfranchised voters
or as unenfranchised talkers.</p>

<p>Thus the men of the Cinque Ports long preserved
a fine tradition of vigorous independence; and in
Sandwich, as in the other ports, the burghers actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
maintained in practice something of the early democratic
theory of government. The mayor, jurats, and
other officers, elected by the whole commonalty,<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>
carried on the administrative and judicial work, but
when a question arose as to the making of new laws
or the granting of cesses the whole people were called
together to a hornblowing,<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> and “the mayor and
commonalty at a common assembly may make such
decrees as they think proper.” Any gathering of
freemen, no matter how small, who assembled with
the mayor, was “deemed a meeting of the whole
body,” and its ordinances were consequently binding;
but the mayor might send the common wardman, or
whom he pleased, to shut up all the windows of
cellars and shops and so forcibly persuade dealers and
artizans to join the congregation.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>This mode of government by a single council of
twelve checked by the <i>referendum</i> lasted unchanged
till the middle of the fifteenth century; and it was
certainly less difficult for the system that in larger
boroughs so quickly developed into the rule of a
plutocracy, to keep its democratic character in a small
community which had only increased from the three
hundred and eighty-three inhabited houses of the
Conqueror’s time to four hundred and twenty households
in 1565,<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> and in which the forces that made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
freedom and popular government were strong. It
would seem indeed that the mayor’s difficulty was not
so much to force the freemen to fulfil their civic
duties, as to check the too active zeal of inhabitants
not enfranchised, and Sandwich had to reiterate its
laws that only free “barons,” indwellers, and householders,
should attend at elections, and at last had to
inflict on any offender a fine of 21<i>d.</i> and the loss of
his upper garment.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>In the middle of the fifteenth century, however,
there was a movement to amend the primitive constitution
of the town. The first change was probably
intended to bring Sandwich into harmony with the
prevailing fashion. In 1437 its eight wards were
made into twelve, and a jurat sat over each, with
power to appoint every year his own constable and
deputy constable.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> Other reforms followed under the
auspices of Richard Cok, who was mayor five times
in thirteen years, and who was again chosen for
the sixth time in 1470 to make peace with Edward
the Fourth after his triumph over Henry the Sixth.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
During his first mayoralty (in 1441) an order was
issued that no one might sit on the bench at court
but the mayor, the jurats, and the king’s bailiff; in
other words the dignity of the upper chamber was
asserted, and all intrusion and interference with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
consultations made impossible. The increasing authority
of the council was immediately met by an
organization of the commons to protect their own
interests, such as we have seen at Norwich and Lynn
half a century earlier. During Cok’s fifth term of
office, in 1454, a representative council of seventy
commons was formed, who, with the consent of the
mayor and jurats, were to make all manner of
elections and all scots and lots. In this way about
one citizen householder out of every six was given a
share in the government&mdash;a scheme so different from
that of either Norwich or Lynn that it suggests how
far Sandwich must have outstripped those towns in
the habit of popular government.</p>

<p>From this time we can trace a steady conflict
between the two parties in the town, the official
or governing class and the commonalty. The common
council was remodelled ten years later, in 1464, and
its members reduced to thirty-six. It is very
probable that this change was brought about by
the policy of the governing class; for at the same
time the mayor and jurats set up a claim to be the
authoritative judges of the fitness of men sent by
the commonalty to serve as councillors, and it was
ordained that the people should henceforth nominate
forty-eight persons, sixteen out of each parish, and
that the mayor and jurats should then choose thirty-six
of these to be of the common council. Their
triumph, however, was short, for in 1471, immediately
after Cok’s last mayoralty, the controlling
choice of mayor and jurats was set aside, and it was
decided that the commonalty should elect for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
without any interference or dictation, twelve
men from each of the three parishes to be of the
common council, to consult with the mayor and
jurats “whenever the mayor pleases” for the benefit
and utility of the town, and to make and establish
decrees for its profit.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<p>For over half a century the democratic party had
their way. Popular representation was recognized
as part of the Sandwich constitution, and so far as
the town itself was concerned, it would seem that
liberal ideas of government and civic freedom prevailed
in a far greater degree than in either Norwich
or Lynn. All went well till the time of Henry the
Eighth. Then a singular danger declared itself, and
the story of the sixteenth century is that of the ruin
of popular liberties in Sandwich. The governing class
had in each of the Cinque Ports a source of peculiar
strength. Out-numbered and out-voted as they
might be in each separate port, they reigned supreme
in the Brodhull court, where their majority was
certain, and where they could carry matters with a
high hand; and it was there that the governing
bodies of the various ports, all alike threatened
with public criticism of their acts and limitation of
their powers, formed a combination for the protection
of their common interests. All devices to establish
freely elected common councils, or any representative
bodies to express popular opinion, received their
quietus at the Brodhull court in 1526. The respectable
assembly of mayors, jurats, and delegates there
gathered passed a resolution that the duties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
electing the mayor and jurats, receiving the king’s
bailiff, and appointing the bailiffs to Yarmouth,
should be given over in each port to a committee
of thirty-seven persons; and in each corporate town
to a body of twenty-four, who were to be nominated
by the mayor and jurats.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> In 1528 a new mayor
of Sandwich was elected after the new fashion, the
whole commonalty nominating three jurats, one of
whom was then chosen by the appointed committee
of thirty-seven.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> That the freemen did not give
up their rights without a fight we may judge
from the fact that in 1535 they again elected their
mayor after the ancient custom of the town; but
it was a losing battle, and as a matter of fact
no popular liberties survived this century. The
common council was reduced to twenty-four members,
and both the upper and lower councils alike
were appointed by the mayor and jurats. The election
of the mayor was taken from the people, and the
jurats succeeded in turn to the post by order of
seniority.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Finally even the right of the commons to
vote at assemblies was taken from them in 1595, to
be restored in 1599, and again taken away “for their
insolence and disorder” in 1603.</p>

<p>In Sandwich, therefore, it is obvious that the reform
movement failed, not through inherent vice or defect
of its own, but by the overpowering pressure of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
external force&mdash;on this occasion by the federal council
of the united states that made up the confederation
of the Cinque Ports. No doubt the easy victory
of the whole confederation was made possible by the
decaying fortunes of the town; for at the time of
its defeat the vigour and the glory of Sandwich had
departed. Works for the preservation of the port
had been constantly going on since the thirteenth
century when the artificial canal known as the Delf
was dug, and put under the charge of overseers; though
after a brave struggle of two hundred years diggers
and sluice-makers could no longer hold their own
against winds and sands that silted up their harbour.
In 1483 the town, under the threat of breaking up
the whole wall they had built, ordered the gentlemen
and yeomen of the country who had pastures by the
stream to scour their dykes and make sluices; though
neither the forced efforts of the county squires, nor
the royal grant to the town in 1548 of all the plate
and treasures of the parish churches to carry on the
works of the harbour;<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> nor a later Act of Parliament
for deepening the Stour, could rescue Sandwich
from its doom. In its decrepitude liberty slipped
from its grasp. But the disaster of a later time must
not wholly obscure with its shadow the records of
days when Sandwich was rejoicing in brighter fortunes.
If in the decay of its prosperity and hope
the oligarchy fixed their yoke on the neck of the
people, and inaugurated the rule of the plutocrats,
their victory was not quickly won; for throughout
the fifteenth century, as we have seen, when by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
necessity of the times the question of stricter organization
of public life was here as elsewhere forced into
prominence, the commons of Sandwich neither renounced
their rights to self-government, nor failed
to take an adequate part in moulding the new constitution.
It is indeed not impossible that the
oligarchic congregation of the Brodhull mainly drew
its force for the suppression of popular independence
from the support or even the instigation of the Court;
for we can easily understand that at a time when
under the policy of the Tudors England figured as a
great power in Europe, laden with obligations and
with hatreds, her ministers were driven to look
anxiously to her first line of defence against foreign
foes. The policy of securing the main ports in the
hands of a little group of loyal officials, easily controlled
from headquarters, and no friends to common
riots or rebellions, must inevitably have followed the
revival of the ancient tradition which saw in the
safety of the realm the whole purpose of the Cinque
Port confederation.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">CONCLUSION</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the reign of Henry the Eighth a wholly new
chapter opens in the history of the towns. In the
preceding centuries we have traced their gradual rise
out of obscure poverty into an illustrious opulence
and dignity. Already in the time of Langland the
poet’s imagination was arrested by the exalted position
of the mayor, the “days-man” who could lay
his hand upon the highest and the lowest&mdash;on the
royal majesty and the mean people of the commune.
When, a hundred and fifty years later, another poet
pictures the court of Fame, where she sits</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Under a glorious cloth of estate ...<br />
Encrowned as empress of all this world of fate.”<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">he sees in the crowd of applicants who press round
the throne to solicit her favours the men of
Dartmouth and Portsmouth and Plymouth, the
burgesses and bailiffs of the Cinque Ports, mingling
with messengers from Thrace and Rounceval. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
were their claims to stand in such a court but a
fantastic fiction of poetry. We have seen how the
commune and the borough&mdash;originally in spite of
their collective character mere feudal lordships like
the rest, introduced under the sanction and protection
of ordinary feudal custom and according to the
fictions of feudal law&mdash;became in course of time a
potent force for the rending asunder of the mediæval
framework of society. Patronized and encouraged by
the king, nourished in great measure at the expense
of the baronage, lay and ecclesiastical, these insidious
communities of the people had gradually revealed a
character of their own alien to the whole feudal
tradition. Under the shelter of their walls the forces
of the middle class were mustered for battle against
the ancient supremacy of the nobility and the Church.
Charters “for the accommodation of the burgesses in
doing their business quietly” became the cover for
their irresistible attack; and the common bell which
rang out to assemble the congregation of enfranchised
burghers perpetually announced in every borough of
the kingdom the ultimate triumph of “the common
people of the realm.”</p>

<p>We have also noted the manner in which during
these centuries the boroughs remained strongholds
of a robust faith in political freedom.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> Theories of
liberty taught by statesmen and philosophers, and
debated by barons and knights in their own manner
at Runnymede, on the battle-field, or in the
council chamber, assumed in the towns homelier
forms, and became the vulgar property of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
The burgher too had his notion of an ideal freedom&mdash;a
freedom which had never entered within the
range of his experience, but in which he still believed
with a transcendent faith. In what manner
the faith had come to him it is hard to say, through
what legal fiction, from what mysterious tradition,
by what dominant instinct of race. To quell the
enemy and the accuser he might call to witness
Domesday or Magna Charta, or liberties registered in
the Old Red Book of the town “as we do think,” or
in the customs of the elders; or for lack of better
authority, the fable of a lost charter of the Saxon
House, or a shadowy local legend, or tale of freedom
“long before the Conquest,”<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> served as evidence of
repute. But for the believer testimony was superfluous;
the very vagueness of his faith was not
without advantages, since the fancied world of the
past might be adequately furnished with types of
all that was desired in the present. Imagination
was stimulated by the rivalry of factions, and
political discussion never ceased. No doubt the
vulgarization of the notion of freedom, thus thrown
into the market-place for burghers to cut and
trim to their own needs, has had a permanent
effect on English thought.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> In communities where
strictly personal ambition in government was reduced
to its lowest expression, where the only possible
tyranny was that of a class or of a group, and where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the whole society of burghers was nourished on
a tradition of equal and indestructible rights, the
privilege coveted by ordinary folk was not the
pleasure of exercizing authority, but the right to
suffer no coercion. Among the townsfolk the
“gentleman” was not the man who ruled his neighbour,
but the enfranchised equal among his fellows.
It may not be altogether fanciful to detect, in the
noble translation of a church collect, not only the fine
intuition of the scholar, but an echo of the spirit of
free and equal liberty that was quickening among
the people at large. If the phrase “Cui servire est
regnare” carried to English ears a foreign thought,
the English words introduced a new and characteristic
meaning&mdash;“Whose service is perfect freedom.”</p>

<p>Lastly we have seen how chequered was the fate of
liberty&mdash;how often it was obstructed and impaired in
its passage through the market-place and the bye-lanes
of the city, driven from shelter to shelter, banished
from the Guildhall, mocked by a false homage. Between
the twelfth century, when the trading communities
had represented a new democracy and led
the attack on the then established magnates of society;
and the sixteenth century, when a ruling oligarchy
had been formed out of their ranks, a vast change
had taken place in the political relations of the
prosperous middle class. In their conduct of the
great struggle for emancipation from the county
potentates, feudal or official, and in their development
of a general freedom of trade, the more prosperous
burghers who had first come to the front in affairs had
proved the champions of a new liberty. The strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
government which they had established through the
administration of a select body of experts had
abundantly justified itself in setting the independence
of the towns beyond attack; and long before the fifteenth
century had opened the boroughs, represented
by their magistrates and councillors, held an impregnable
position. Meanwhile, however, the wave of
industrial progress began slowly to lift up out of
their dumb helplessness the masses who had till now
learned obedience of poverty and despair, for “While
hunger was their master would none strive.” Imperceptibly
the whole scene was changed, and a new
conflict was seen to be preparing. By the slow
changes of time what had been the democracy of
1200 had become the oligarchy of 1500. On the
one hand the plutocrats of the boroughs had made
their way into the circle of the privileged classes;
in a thousand points their interests now coincided
with those of the officials and the gentry in the
counties; and their conservative instincts had won
the confidence and sympathy of the court. On the
other hand the humbler sort of traders and artizans,
congregated more and more thickly at the busy
centres of industry, made familiar with the uses
and methods of association, and impatient both of
tyranny and of want, were beginning to form a new
democracy, and to constitute to the comfortable
classes an alarming social danger. In every borough
the problems which confront the modern world were
formulated. On all side agitators proclaimed the
right of the workers to have a voice in the organization
of trade, and the right of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
burghers to share in the control of municipal
affairs. The demand of the people that government
should really be carried on by their consent, so
easily stifled in the thirteenth century, became in
the fifteenth loud and persistent; and riotous
confederacies of labourers and artizans added excitement
to the political demonstrations in the
streets. A new terror invaded the council-chamber
of the Guildhall&mdash;the terror of the mob. While the
craft-masters hastened to fortify the guild against the
forces of misrule, town councillors made strong the
borough administration in the interests of good order.
The history of the municipalities in the fifteenth
century is far from indicating an era of political
apathy, or of mere civic indolence and corruption.
In the records of the trade fraternities we see the
opening of an industrial war. In the constitutions
and ordinances of the towns we see the foreshadowing
of a political revolution. The original struggle
with feudal forces had closed in triumph for the
boroughs, and a new conflict now takes its beginning.
Faction fights, crafty intrigues, intricate constitutional
changes, these signalise the opening of a new
controversy&mdash;the controversy between the middle
and the lower classes.</p>

<p>At the very moment however when this division of
social forces had declared itself, and when it seemed as
though the attention of England was to be concentrated
on the new social problem, the whole movement
was suddenly arrested. All speculation as to what
might have happened in the course of a natural
evolution is utterly vain. It is probable indeed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the poorer classes, unfed, untaught, and undisciplined,
were at that time wholly unprepared to enter on any
struggle for industrial and political emancipation,
and if the battle had been really fought out, must
have suffered a crushing defeat. Centuries of discipline
have been needed to consolidate their forces,
and very possibly the course of freedom was best
served by delay. As a matter of fact however the
social question was cast aside by external and arbitrary
forces. It was engulfed in the political
revolution inaugurated by the early Tudors. So
violent was the change that it is only in our own
age that the controversies which were opening in the
fifteenth century have again taken the foremost
place.</p>

<p>For from the moment when the history of national
politics begins under the Tudor kings, the whole
character and significance of the local centres of
government undergo a profound change. Henry the
Seventh, as we have seen, had laid the foundation of
a vast commercial policy; but until the reign of
Henry the Eighth, England, unconscious of its capacity
and of its destiny, stood aloof from European affairs;
and with her small population, her inadequate navy,
her somewhat old-fashioned army, her feeble political
influence, was little more than an upstart in the august
society of continental nations. From this position
she was raised by the genius of Wolsey into a State of
which it might be said that its Crown “is this day
more esteemed than the Emperor’s Crown and all his
Empire;” and of whose minister a Venetian ambassador
reports that “he is seven times more powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
than the Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> In a very few years England,
courted by French and Spanish kings, and able to
treat on equal terms with Pope and Emperor, boasted
of being mediator and arbiter of European politics.
The pride of a great mission exalted the imagination
of her people, and a poet of the Renascence in his
vision of “all manner of nations” who dwelt on the
field of fame, marked the gate of chalcedony which
gave entrance to “Anglia.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The building thereof was passing commendable;<br />
Whereon stood a leopard, crowned with gold and stones,<br />
Terrible of countenance and passing formidable, ...<br />
As fiercely frowning as he had been fighting.”<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p class="p1">By the royal courage and appetite of Henry the
Eighth, bent on making the whole people his accomplices
for the carrying out of his personal will, the
work of Wolsey was continued, though in a very
different temper, and the national pride and confidence
pushed to the highest point. If the policy
of Cromwell had been fully carried out, the history
of the Reformation and the fortunes of Europe
might have been reversed by the intervention of
England. We can well understand that amid these
tremendous schemes local aspirations were forgotten
and local quarrellings silenced. To perfect the
policy of the new Monarchy the destinies of the
several towns were submerged in the destinies of the
whole Commonwealth. Sovereigns no longer viewed
with interested regard or with indifferent tolerance,
as of old,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> the growth of borough franchises and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
developement of local governments. Street riots were
no longer matters of the parish, but of the State.
The king’s hand was stretched out over the wealthy
corporations whose liberties had grown into such vast
proportions, and like the baronage and the Church,
the boroughs were laid prostrate before the throne.</p>

<p>For under the Tudor system of government the
king was the necessary centre of every interest in the
country.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> He alone could impose a common policy
and give expression to a national will. To him all
classes looked to defend their cause and ensure their
prosperity, in the implicit faith that he lived for them
alone and to perform their will. In the royal power
lay the one force by which England could be held
together. At an earlier time, indeed, the common
folk had repudiated the doctrine of the king’s absolute
supremacy as it was now understood. “They
say that the king should live upon his commons, and
that their bodies and goods are his: the contrary is
true, for then needed him never to set Parliament and
to ask good of them.”<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> But now new maxims were
scattered abroad&mdash;“that the king can do no wrong,
however much he may wish to do it; that not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the property but the persons of his subjects are his
own; and that a man has a right to no more than
the king’s goodness thinks fit not to take from him.”
Parliament almost ceased to exist, until in course of
time, packed with members carefully nominated, and
by the craft of the king elaborately duped, it was
turned into a mere instrument by which the most
ruthless acts of royal aggression could be given the
stamp and semblance of law.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>The new centralized government was carried on
by means of a vast official system which extended
from the highest to the lowest departments, and
reached out to the farthest limits of the country. In
its efficient form it was practically the creation of the
first Tudor king. With Warwick the baronial leaders
of an earlier time had passed away; and the weakened
remnant of the baronage which emerged from the
civil wars had been carefully depressed by Henry the
Seventh. At the council-board their places were
taken by officials who received their orders directly
from the king; and when the barons returned to
office and council they returned as fellow servants
with the new officials, and holding the same functions.
Henry the Eighth carried out the same policy. The
great nobles might complain of “low-born knaves”
who surrounded the king; but when the minister
“clapped his rod upon the board” silence fell on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
obsequious council&mdash;and barons and commons alike
trembled before the son of an Ipswich merchant or a
Putney blacksmith.</p>

<p>For the tremendous power of Wolsey or of Cromwell
lay in the fact that the whole hierarchy of officials,
from the most exalted to the most base, was directly
responsible to him. Every figure of any importance
in the country was perfectly well known to the
minister at the head of affairs, and on every subordinate
through the length and breadth of the
land the court kept vigilant watch. If an official at
any point disagreed with the opinions held at head
quarters he was forthwith turned out of office, and
the ease with which Henry and his successors made
national revolutions is the measure of the absolute
perfection to which the machinery of their administration
had been brought. In the boroughs
it is impossible to exaggerate the effect of this
political revolution. The consequence to which the
towns had risen made of them all-important centres
of administration for the maintenance of general
order. Two-thirds of the members of Parliament
were sent from the boroughs, and the control of these
members, therefore, meant the control of the House
of Commons. For a two-fold reason, therefore, the
tendency long shewn by the Court to sympathize
with the governing oligarchy in the municipalities
inevitably took from this time a new force. Under
the oligarchic system of administration the towns
could be held for the king by a mere handful of loyal
officials; and the influence of the Crown was naturally
flung on the side of the representatives of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
order, as it was understood by the government. In
the interests of the whole State a new policy was
developed. Municipal independence was struck
down at the very roots, and the free growth of earlier
days arrested by an iron discipline invented at Westminster,
and enforced by a selected company of
Townhall officials, whose authority was felt to be
ultimately supported by the majesty of the king
himself. The number of the town councillors was
constantly diminished, and the liberties of the commons
curtailed. Under the new conditions the individual
life of the borough ceased to have the same
significance as of old, and an era opened in which its
highest destiny was to be employed as an instrument
of the royal will for national ends, and its only glory
lay in forming one of the members of a mighty commonwealth.
To follow out the internal record of municipal
politics on the old lines, as though the story of
the sixteenth century were the natural consequence
of their earlier course of developement would be
radically false; and I therefore pause on the threshold
of the new state of things. The history of the
boroughs as schools in which the new middle class
received its training for service in the field of national
politics, and as the laboratories in which they made
their most fruitful experiments in administration,
ends before the close of the fifteenth century. It
may be that as the working class in its turn rises to
take its place alongside of its predecessors on the
stage of public affairs, the towns will again become
centres of interest in the national story, as the
workshops of an enlarged political science.</p>

At Lynn there was in 1383 a Guild “of young scholars”; at
Worcester the Guild of S. Nicholas kept “time out of mind a free
school within the said city in a great hall belonging to the
said Guild called the Trinity Hall.” The Guild of Palmers supported
a school at Ludlow; and so did Guilds at Stratford and
at Deritend. The Guild of Kalenders in Bristol had in the
twelfth century kept a school of Jews, and when that business
came to an end were still charged with education, public
lectures, and the management of a free library. (English Guilds,
51, 205, 196, 221, 288. See Hunt’s Bristol, 112, 249, 260.) The
Drapers had a school at Shrewsbury (Hibbert’s Inf. of English
Guilds, 33); and the Merchant Tailors in London (Clode, 35).
I learn from Mr. A. F. Leach that at Ashburton the Grammar
School founded 1314 by Bishop Stapledon of Exeter (who also
founded Exeter College) was entrusted to the Guild of St.
Lawrence, whose chantry-priest was the schoolmaster. The
school is still kept on the site of the Guild Chapel, the original
tower of which forms part of the School.</p>

Bentham’s History of Ely Cathedral, 2nd Edition, 182. Hull
Grammar School Gazette, 1891, No. 8, p. 88. See Riley’s Liber
Albus, xix. There was a grammar master at Ewelme Almshouse
1461 (ibid. 627), where teaching was to be free (ibid. ix. 217-8).
Four new grammar schools were opened in London in 1447, and
during the reign of Henry the Sixth nine were set up in
London alone (Pauli’s Pictures, 452). In 1472 Prior Selling, of
Christchurch, reports to the Archbishop of Canterbury that he
has provided a “schoolmaster for your grammar schools in
Canterbury, the which hath lately taught grammar at
Winchester and at S. Antony’s in London” (Hist. MSS. Com.
ix. 105). John Syre, the grammar school master in 1436, lived
in Gayhow’s tenement, S. Alphege parish (ibid. 139). The
Almshouse of the poor sisters in Reading was in 1486 turned
into a grammar school (Coates’ Reading, 15); there was a school
in Appleby taught by a chantry priest before the middle of the
fifteenth century (Transactions of Cumberland and Westmoreland
Arch. Soc. part ii. vol. viii.); and one in Preston whose
master was made a burgess in 1415 (Memorials of Preston
Guilds, 14). In Liverpool there was an endowed free school
before the reformation (Picton’s Memorials, ii. 55-6). Miss
Dormer Harris has learned from the town records that the
expenses of the grammar school at Coventry in the fifteenth
century, were paid by the Trinity Guild&mdash;in other words, by the
Corporation. It is evident that when William Bingham, who
founded a grammar school attached to Clare Hall, Cambridge,
says that in 1439 he passed seventy deserted schools in travelling
from Hampton to Ripon by way of Coventry (Boase’s
Oxford, 108), we cannot infer from this any decay in education.
It may have indicated a shifting of population, or more probably
perhaps the results of the effort made in 1391 to prevent villeins
from being put to the clerical schools in preparation for taking
minor orders and so gaining emancipation from their lords. Rot.

Wotton-under-Edge, and was founded by a woman, Lady
Berkeley, in 1385.</p>

The author of Piers Ploughman criticizes the education given
by the clerics of his day. “Grammar that ground is of all” was
neglected so that no one could now either “versify fair” or construe
what the poets wrote.</p>
<p class="pf8q">“Doctors of degree and of divinity masters<br />
That should the seven arts conne and assoil <i>ad quodlibet</i>,<br />
But they fail in philosophy, an philosophers lived<br />
And would well examine them, wonder me thinketh!”</p>

The “alphabet and the humanities” did not imply culture in
anything like our sense of the word, nor yet Latin from the
literary point of view, but the old ecclesiastical discipline,
which included above all things <i>logic</i>, and which ultimately led,
if the pupil advanced far enough, to the scholastic philosophy.
Thus for example in the <i>Epistolæ obscurorum virorum</i> one of the
(priestly) correspondents is made to protest against the introduction
of the study of Vergil and other new-fangled writers.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Erasmus, in his Praise of Folly, singles the schoolmasters
out as “a race of men the most miserable, who grow
old in penury and filth in their schools&mdash;<i>schools</i> did I say?
<i>prisons! dungeons!</i> I should have said&mdash;among their boys,
deafened with din, poisoned by a fetid atmosphere; but thanks
to their folly perfectly self-satisfied so long as they can bawl
and shout to their terrified boys, and box and beat and flog
them, and so indulge in all kinds of ways their cruel disposition.”
One such master he tells of who to crush boys’
unruly spirits, and to subdue the wantonness of their age,
never took a meal with his flock without making the comedy
end in a tragedy. “So at the end of the meal one or another
boy was dragged out to be flogged.” Boase’s Oxford, 76-77.</p>

“Feria” or Saint’s day. The place originally held by the
fair is illustrated by the ancient custom in Leicester, that when
merchants went to the great fairs, when the “fairs were up no
plea was holden no more of them that were at home, than of
them that were at the fairs;” this was altered by Crouchback’s
charter of 1277, so that those who stayed at home might
be tried in case of complaint. Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 423-4.</p>

The Fair of Wycombe was held on the Day of S. Thomas
the Martyr from time out of mind. It had begun to decline by
1527, and the Mayor and Bailiffs bitterly complained that now
scarcely any one came to keep up the fair and that the shopkeepers
kept their shops and stalls at home in the town as usual. A
strict order was made by the Council in 1527 that “no manner
of man nor woman” should keep open shop in the town on that
day or show their goods in the street, but should “resort unto
the Fair there as it is wont to be kept.” Parker’s Hist. of
Wycombe, 29.</p>

all that could corrupt and infect the air and bring disease. 12
Richard II. cap. 13. The shambles were commonly at the very
corner of the Tol-booth or Moot Hall. Hewitson’s Hist. of
Preston, 36. See Shillingford’s Letters, 89. But in 1487 the
Londoners after sixteen years continual remonstrance obtained
a statute that no butcher was to kill any beast within the walls
of the town, and that the same law was to be observed in all
walled towns of England except Berwick and Carlisle. 4 Henry

A grant for paving was given to Liverpool in 1329.
Picton’s Mun. Rec. of Liverpool, i. 10. Southampton appointed
in 1482 a “pavyour” who should dwell in a house of the town
at a price of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> rent free “and to have yearly a gown.”
Davies, 119, 120. Nottingham decided in 1501 to have a town
paviour at a salary of 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and a gown; and gave order that
the chamberlains were to find stones and sand. Nottingham

had given her free consent openly in the Mayor’s Court. (Nott.

The loaf was changed in weight not in price with the price
of corn; the lowest rate conceived by ancient writers was 12<i>d.</i>
a quarter of corn; the unit of bread was 1/4<i>d.</i> loaf. (Hist. MSS.
Com. ix. 175.) Twelve kinds are mentioned in the fifteenth
century, but in the Assize only three sorts were recognized&mdash;Wastel
or white or well-baked bread; Coket (seconds); Simnel,
twice baked bread, used only in Lent. (English Guilds, 102.

The town liberties did not always extend over the whole town

district in the centre of the modern town, and did not extend
beyond the limits of this “ancient city.” Hereford up till 1830
was divided into two parts, the In-Borough where the inhabitant

Picton’s Municipal Records of Liverpool, i. 17, 18, 28. It is
evident that the system of protection was not universally popular,
for when in 1515 a commission was sent to examine why
Liverpool had so decayed that its contributions to the Exchequer
had fallen off, a complaint was made that the mayor had caused
the decline in the customs revenue by the enfranchisement of
strangers living in the borough, who were thus freed from the
payment of dues that had once gone to the Crown. (Picton’s
Memorials, i. 38.) Leland writing in 1533 says: “Irish merchants
come much thither as to a good haven,” and in the margin
he adds, “at Liverpool is a small custom paid that causeth merchants
to resort.” The trade of later days had even then begun:
“Good merchants at Liverpool, much Irish yarn that Manchester
men do buy there.” (Ibid. i. 46.)</p>

For example William Hollingbroke of Romney, whose wife
Joanna sold blankets in 1373, was one of the members sent to
Parliament and headed the list of taxpayers in a ward named
after him Hollingbroke Ward from 1384 till 1401. Then his
widow took his place till she retired from business in 1404, and
the once opulent family, for a time represented by a single trader
Stephen, seems finally to have become extinct in 1441. The
chief position in local trade then passed to the Stuppeneys who
settled in the town in 1436 and whose local fame is still recalled
by the fact that even now the yearly election of the Mayor of
Romney takes place in the church of S. Nicholas at the tomb of
one of them who was Jurat of the town.</p>

Piers Ploughman. Pass. iv. 83. A prosperous cook at Oxford
in 1400 married his daughter to one Lelham “Dominus de
Grove.” By the marriage contract the cook was to give to
Lelham twenty marks to be paid at intervals; to the bride
and bridegroom he was to give three tenements in Oxford; he
was to make provision for them in his own house for eight years,
and when after that they were to be set up in a house of their
own he was to provide them with a bed, blankets, sheets, and all
other furniture needful for the same bed, a vessel for water, a
wine vase, two tablecloths, two towels, twelve silver spoons, two

that trade is nothing but pure barter.</p>

John Russel, one of Fastolf’s servants, paid a sum down to be
appointed Searcher at Yarmouth. And Thomas Fry, a steward
of the Berkeleys under Henry the Seventh and Henry the

commission of the peace of the city of Coventry, and a steward
of great power in that Corporation.” (Berkeleys, ii. 215.)</p>

Kent had sunk from the fifth to the tenth place in wealth
among counties during the Hundred Years’ War. In 1454 the
wool of Lincolnshire, Shropshire, and the Cotswolds, represented the
best, and that of Kent almost the worst quality; this may account
for the decline of Canterbury. The difference in quality would of
course tell much more on the prosperity of a district when the
home manufacture of cloth was developed.</p>

Lib. Cus. 127. I suspect that the question of these fulling-mills
in London was much complicated by the supply of water
becoming inadequate to the needs of the growing city, and the
great resentment felt by the fullers of cloth against the intrusion
of the cap-makers on their domain over the running streams.
There is some evidence that this was the case, and it is probable
that the want of water-power was one of the causes which drove
the woollen manufacture from certain towns.</p>

Stat. 1 Richard III. cap. 9. About 1528 the London shoemakers
complain that whereas the King had granted leave that
a fraternity of forty-four foreigners might exercise the craft of
shoemakers in the city, by colour of this grant 220 foreign householders
employing over 400 apprentices and servants, had set up
in the business. An amusing account is given of the attitude of
this foreign company to the English searchers of the craft. There
had once been 140 Englishmen of the cordwainers’ livery but now
there were only twenty, and the wives and children of those who
had been ruined were turned into water-carriers and labourers.
These foreigners did not come to settle, but having made their
fortunes went off home, while others took their places. (Schanz,
ii. 598-600.)</p>

It is important in the town ordinances to observe the effect
of local circumstances. For instance, in Coventry the weavers
were allowed in 1424 to take as many apprentices as they liked,
“sine contradictione alicujus,” while the number in other trades
was limited. This was just such an order as might be expected
of a town council of rich merchant clothiers and drapers.</p>

No general laws for the whole kingdom which seriously
limited the employment of apprentices were passed before the
sixteenth century, but the various towns made such local laws as
seemed necessary. In most cases masters were bound to enrol their
apprentices in the town court; and at the end of the fifteenth
century the Town Councils and the Guilds were making serious
efforts to enforce the law. Miss Dormer Harris tells me that the
capper’s apprentices in Coventry were bound by surety for £5 to
fulfil their covenant. If an apprentice left his master before the
seven years were over, the master might not take another till the
time had expired unless he delivered the £5 to the keepers for
the use of the craft. The masters of crafts there appear to have
been very reluctant to take apprentices, especially after 1494.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_217_217" id="Footnote_217_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_217_217"><span class="label">[217]</span></a></span>
In Norwich in spite of the statutes of 1436 and 1503 (15
Henry VI. cap. 6; 19 Henry VII. cap. 7) the crafts persisted in
making rules by which apprentices were compelled to pay 20<i>s.</i> or
30<i>s.</i> for entry into the common hall (compare the composition of
1415 in the Norwich documents)&mdash;a fine which meant that the
craftsmen were practically denied the freedom of the city, and
therefore the position of master, and were thus forced to swell
the body of journeymen. An Act passed in 1531 ordered that
no apprentice should pay more than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for entry into the
common hall; or 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> at the end of the term for the freedom
of the company; but the companies evaded this law by
asking only the statute sum for the freedom of the company,
but making the candidates swear they would not trade
without license, for which they had to pay at the company’s
pleasure. This was again forbidden by Henry in 1537
(Blomefield, iii. 181-2). Among the weavers of Newcastle in
1527 all who had finished their apprenticeship were admitted
to membership on payment of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, but any man of the craft
desirous to be of the fellowship a brother thereof, with power to
set up shop, had to pay £20 (Newcastle Guilds). The London
grocers in 1345 paid 20<i>s.</i> for each apprentice; the apprentice
who wished to belong to the fraternity paid 40<i>s.</i> on leaving his
master (Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i. 11, 12).</p>

Journeymen among the cutlers and founders who had not
served their time as apprentices could only get such wages as the
overseers of the trade allowed to them after examination. (Riley’s
Mem. Lond. 439, 514.) The system was probably widespread to
judge from the many ordinances concerning wages. Unskilled
journeymen must be spoken of in the ordinances of the bladesmiths.
(Riley’s Mem. 570.) For serving-men who worked by
the day for the glovers see ibid. 246. In 1449 at Coventry a
reasonable wage seems to have been 4<i>d.</i> a day; but a capper’s
journeyman in 1496 got 12<i>d.</i> a week working twelve hours a
day (reference to Coventry records given me by Miss Dormer
Harris).</p>

The law was done away with when it turned to the hurt of
the employers. In a later state of the cloth industry some of
the old centres of industry such as London and Norwich and
Bristol found their wealth decayed; and decided that their trade
was starved for want of workmen while the young people were
growing up to idleness and vice. Then the masters, actually
threatened with the loss of their manufacturing industries,
insisted on new laws allowing them to take apprentices without
regard to the Act of Henry the Fourth (11 Henry VII. cap. 11;
12 Henry VII. cap. 1).</p>

system may even then have been like the ordinary system which
generally prevailed till the end of the last century. In Dereham
in Norfolk the site of a line of hovels is still marked in which a
group of shoemakers lived and worked for the Norwich masters,
whose collector came round every week to collect the finished
work. A rich farmer seems to have served as a sort of contractor
in the tailoring trade; the upper floor of his house immediately
below the roof formed a long room without any partitions in
which ten or twelve tailors worked by day and slept by night,
and the contractor dispatched their work to the Norwich dealer.</p>

This was sometimes done by royal charter. (Hibbert’s
Influence of Eng. Guilds, 96.) All the facts are against the
theory of Marx that the merchant was by some hostile force
prevented from buying labour, though allowed to buy other
commodities. The limitations were of the merchants’ and dealers’
own making for their own purposes. It is equally improbable
that the guild organization excluded division of labour in the
workshop. (Marx, Capital, &amp;c. i. 352.)</p>

In 1311 the “hatters” and the “dealers who bought and
sold hats” in London were two quite distinct callings. (Riley’s
Mem. 90.) The distinction was well known in 1327 between the
saddlers and the various orders of workmen employed in manufacturing
for them. (Ibid. 157-8.)</p>

A separation of the guilds into these groups is sufficient of
itself to shew of how little value the generalizations of Marx
are as to the relations of the crafts to capital; and how misleading
it is to represent the guilds as providing the main opposition
to merchants or capitalists, especially in the matter of refusing
the supply of labour. (See Marx i. 352.)</p>

Seligman (Two Chapters on Mediæval Guilds, 69) states that
the crafts were not charitable associations giving relief to poor
members till the fifteenth century. Out of twelve crafts mentioned
in English Guilds, nine gave relief to poor, and three do not
mention it. For the Braelers in London, 1355, see Riley’s Mem.
277; the White tawyers, 1346, ibid. 232; the Lorimers, 1261,
Liber Cust. 78-80. Most of the ordinances in Riley’s Mem.
make no mention of relief, but the ordinances are so manifestly
incomplete&mdash;merely additions or alterations made for some special
purpose&mdash;that no argument can be drawn from them. The vast
majority of religious or social guilds had some charitable provisions,
and in many cases these were certainly trade guilds.
The probability seems to lie on the side of help given to poor
members from the first.</p>

The way in which the guilds fought in defence of their voluntary
courts of arbitration, and the objection of the towns to these,
is in itself proof enough of the importance to their members of a
tribunal, however voluntary and arbitrary, which might relieve
them from the interference on every occasion of the local
magistrates, and the party politics of the town. The advantages
of association in case of being called before the greater courts is
evident from the account of mediæval procedure given in Sir J.
Stephen’s History of the Criminal Law. The illustrations
afforded by the Paston Letters are without number. See
Manorial Pleas (Selden Soc.), 136. For the heavy cost involved
by the corrupt practices of lawyers, judges, pleaders, and attorneys,
see the action brought in 1275 by an advocate against
an employer who had withdrawn from the case; the advocate
sues for his fees and also for having been prevented by the
stopping of the case from getting a very large sum of money out
of the other side. (Ibid. 155-6.)</p>

It was a disgrace to the lord if any of his “livery” appeared
in the law courts. The protection extended to the members of
a craft was really efficient. See the punishment of a grocer who
in 1404 had turned another of the company out of his house.
(Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i. 93.)</p>

The grocers in London claimed control over every one who
kept a shop of spicery even if he did not wear their livery
(Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i. 66); but those who refused the
livery were fined. The liveried members paid 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the
dinner, and “every man out of the clothing as us seemed they
might bear.” (Ibid. ii. 239, 258.) A list was kept of those who
wore the livery, those who wore gowns, and householders and
bachelors not in livery. (Ibid. 175-177.)</p>

These divisions must be taken in a general sense. Five
orders are mentioned among the Merchant Taylors (Clode, 8-9);
but these really fall into three main groups. For our present
purpose the “Bachelors,” an intermediate rank formed in some
of the richer crafts, may be omitted.</p>

If a craftsman not admitted to the freedom of the guild took
work, the customer in case of fraud had only the protection of

From time to time there were protests on the part of the
members of the craft against the power of the oligarchy.
There was such a case in the London Grocers’ Company, when
an attempt was made in 1444 to limit the power of the wardens
in appointing new members. (Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i.
123.)</p>

159, 162, 217, 160, 169, 31, 164, 167, 318, 445. The weavers’
guild was governed by a council of twenty-four as early as the
thirteenth century. (Lib. Cus. 424.) In religious or social
guilds there were cases where the election of officers was made by
the assent of all the brethren (English Guilds, 47, 49, 148, 213,
232), or “with the assent of the <i>elder part</i> of the brethren and
sistern of the guild” (ibid. 150); but the prevailing custom was
the appointment of picked men to choose the officers. (English
Guilds, 62, 64, 71, 75, 83, 89, 91, 97, 119, 266.) In one case
“all the brethren whom the alderman should send for” were to
elect officers. (Ibid. 35.) In another the alderman chose two
men, the company chose two others, these four chose two more,
and the six elected officers. In a later form copied for another
craft instead of the “company” the “masters of the guild” chose
two men. (Ibid. 276.) In one case a new provost was chosen
by the four provosts of the past year. (Ibid. 186.) In the
Grocers’ Company the wardens appointed their successors.
(Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i. 10, 14, 18.) A similar custom
prevailed in the Southampton Guild Merchant.</p>

Riley’s Mem. 348. In the Cordwainers’ Guild of Exeter
(1481) two of the wardens were chosen from the shop-holders, and
two from the journeymen. (English Guilds, 332.) It would
seem that among the coruesers of Bristol the journeymen had a
certain recognized position, the visible sign of which was their
having the right to provide lights carried in the municipal
processions at certain feasts; and when in 1454 “divers
debates and murmurs had arisen between the masters and crafts
of the coruesers and the journeymen,” and the masters and
craft-holders sought to deprive the journeymen of this right, the
attempt was vigorously and successfully resisted.</p>

In Ipswich when a youth in 1448 was apprenticed to a barber
for seven years it was stipulated that he should get suitable clothing,
shoes, bedding, board, and chastisement. (Hist. MSS. Com.
ix. 259.) At Romney in 1451 it was decreed that at the end of
his service the apprentice should receive from his master 10<i>s.</i> or
a bed of that value. (Ibid. v. 543). A decree against using
daggers or knives or making any affray was limited by the phrase,
“provided always that it shall be lawful to any inhabitant to
correct his servant or apprentice according to the law.” (English
Guilds, 390.) But on the other hand when a master among the
tailors at Exeter chastised his servant so far as to bruise his arm
and break his head, he had not only to give a fine to the craft but
to give the servant 15<i>s.</i> and a month’s board and to pay his doctor.
(Ibid. 322.)</p>

A master retiring from trade might sell and devise the
services of his apprentice to a new master, but if there was any
suspicion that a sale had been so managed that the apprentice
lost credit for one or two years of the service which he had
actually fulfilled both the masters were deprived of the freedom
of the city and craft. (Paston Letters, i. 378.)</p>

Riley’s Mem. Lond. 307; English Guilds, 285-6. Piece-work
was common in many trades. In Newcastle the guild of fullers
and dyers in their ordinances of 1477 regulated the price of fulling
and shearing the various kinds of cloth by piece-work at so much
a yard. The weavers also worked by the piece. The Newcastle
slaters had been formed into a guild and had ordinances in 1451
with similar regulations; the bricklayers and plasterers were in
a guild in 1454 (Newcastle Guilds). There was piece-work
among the tawyers. (Riley’s Mem. Lond. 330-1.) In Winchester
the weavers probably worked at from 3<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> a day, as they
were ordered to take from Hallow Eve to the Annunciation for
their work but 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and from the Annunciation to Hallow
Eve but 2<i>s.</i></p>

and the scanty supply, so that “without great difficulty
the city cannot be provided sufficiently of sea-coals for the poor.”

In 1327 Edward the Third granted a charter to the girdlers of
London, which took in all the girdlers of the kingdom, ordered
them under the same rules, and set them under the Mayors of
whatever city they might be in. (Riley’s Mem. 154-5).</p>

Some charters were given by Edward the Fourth and later Kings
to companies of Tailors, Merchants, and so on, which gave them an
existence independent of the town, and power to make their own
ordinances. (See p. 173.) No list has been made out of these companies,
and the subject needs investigation. From the cases which
I have met with I think it may probably turn out that such
charters were generally given to companies with a foreign trade,
and given for reasons referring to that trade. The second charter
of the Merchant Tailors in 1390 allowed them to make ordinances
among themselves and of their own authority. (Clode, 3.) This
charter seems to have freed them from the Mayor, but if so they
were again put under his control in 1436. (Ibid. 5, see pp. 189-191,
193.) This was followed by a violent attempt in 1442 to
have a Mayor of their own company, which failed and caused
much anger. It is evident from the charter of Henry the Seventh,
in 1502, which confirmed their independence, that they dealt in “all
and every kinds of merchandises” “in all quarters and kingdoms
of the world.” (Ibid. 7, 195.) By this they were again given full
power to make ordinances for themselves without interference, so
long as these were not contrary to the laws of the kingdom nor to
the prejudice of the Mayor; and the Mayor was wholly deprived
of the power of search among their subjects&mdash;a most important
measure, since the master and wardens “had a great number of
householders with their servants to rule and govern.” (Ibid.
197-200.)</p>

Though guilds were forbidden in Norwich they existed,
doubtless by the payment of annual fines. In the case of the
tanners the complaint in 1287 against them was clearly that in
case of disputes they “made plaint” to their own aldermen and
not to the bailiffs. (Hudson’s Leet Jurisdiction in Norwich
(Selden Soc.) p. 13.) The cobblers had apparently an important
guild from the money paid; the saddlers, tanners, and fullers had
also guilds in 1292. (Ibid. 39, 42, 43.) The King reserved the
power of creating guilds, and it was possibly to prevent his exercising
it that towns like Norwich and Coventry obtained by charter
the right to have no guilds. Such a privilege freed them from the
fear of fraternities independent of the municipality, while it left
them free to recognise informally associations whose recurring
fines were really the tribute paid for existence.</p>

Some of those so-called religious, but really trading guilds,
have been identified. It is clear that the guild of S. Benedict at
Lincoln was a society of traders or merchants, who traded on
loans from the common fund, paying back half of the increase
they made on it. (English Guilds, 174.) Among other instances
see the Guild of S. John Baptist at Hull (Lambert’s Guild Life,
112, etc. 118, 232, 233); Corpus Christi (ibid. 124); Holy
Trinity (ibid. 126.) A very curious and interesting account of
the formal founding of the Pepperers’ Company as the Fraternity
of S. Anthony in the Monastery of Bury, 1345, is given in
Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i., xvii. Compare the records given
on 8-15. It had become the Grocers’ Company by 1373. The
Drapers’ Guild in Shrewsbury was originally the Guild of the
Trinity. (Hibbert’s Inf. and Dev. of Eng. Guilds, 32.) For
other instances see Chapter V. The custom was so common
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that it is highly probable
that under any stress of difficulty it would have been resorted to
in earlier days. The artizans must have been fully aware of the
fact disclosed to us by the two forms of summonses for guild
returns issued in 1388, one for the religious and one for the
trading guilds&mdash;the fact that the two forms of association
were regarded in a different way by the government. Some guilds
are avowedly of a double character. (English Guilds, 126-128,
179-185.)</p>

and merchants of Norwich the supervision of the
cloth trade that had been granted to them in 1348 (Ashley,
Woollen Industry, 54-5); and handed over to the mayor,
sheriffs, and commonalty of Norwich, the right of measuring
and sealing all worsteds made in Norwich or Norfolk. (Blomefield,
iii. 125.) A later law enacted that “the worsted
shearers in Norwich shall make no ordinance but such as
the Mayor and Alderman shall think necessary.” (Stat. 1494,
cap. xi.) In the fifteenth century the Privy Council took
away from the Bakers’ and Tailors’ Crafts in London the right of
search in their trades which had been granted to their Wardens,
and restored it to the Mayor, and ordered the crafts to obey the
Mayor after the old usages, customs, and laws of London. 1442.

Ricart, 78. The examples are too numerous to give. But
see the ordinances drawn up in 1448 for the Tailors’ Guild of
Lynn by the Mayor and the Council. It was ordered that no
new tailor should set up in business unless he was considered
“sufficient in conning” not only by the two head men of his
craft, but also by the mayor. Every tailor admitted to the guild
had to pay a fine as entrance fee to the Mayor and another to
the community, as well as his payment to the Guild; and paid a
yearly fee to the town for any sewers and apprentices whom he
employed. Quarrels between shapers and sewers were to be
settled by the Mayor and the head men of the craft. If a
tailor sent home an ill-fitting garment the buyer might bring
his complaint to the Mayor’s Court, and claim amends before
the Mayor and the head men of the craft on condition of paying
a fine of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> if he did not prove his case. (Hist. MSS. Com.
xi. 3, 165-6.)</p>

Miss Dormer Harris has kindly given me the rules at
Coventry as to how a craft was to proceed to the punishment of
a member in 1518. The master of the craft was first to ask a
“reasonable penalty;” if the offender refused to pay, the master
was to apply again after three or four days and have the refusal
recorded; and in case the refusal was repeated a second time
he and three or four of the “honest men” of the craft
were to come to the mayor; and the mayor and one of the
justices were to command the offender to pay a double penalty;
and if he refused yet again, to commit him to prison until it was
paid to the craft. At the same time the offender was to desire the
master to be “good master to him and his good lover.” If the
penalty were more than would suffice for a pound of wax, the
remainder was to go to common box, <i>i.e.</i>, the city funds.</p>

The tilers were strictly ruled by statute as to how the various
tiles should be made, thatch tile, roof tile, gutter tile, and so on;
how the earth should be prepared and how big the tiles should be.
Justices of the Peace, that is in towns the Mayor and the Aldermen,
were to hear the cases against offenders and appoint
searchers. (17 Edward IV. cap. 4.)</p>

Enforced contribution of crafts was common; and the cost

there were complaints in 1494 that the dyers, skinners, fishmongers,
&amp;c., were so “self-willed” that they could not be made
to contribute to pageants. See Hibbert’s Inf. and Dev. of Eng.
Gilds, 63. For the whole question of plays and pageants see
Davidson’s Studies in Eng. Mystery Plays, printed by Yale
University, 1892. The Corpus Christi processions became after
the order of the Council of Vienne, 1318, exceedingly popular; the
guilds of Corpus Christi, having charge of the procession, not
of the plays (91-2), were probably generally composed of the
upper class of people. A list of Miracle Plays and Mysteries has
been made for students by F. Stoddard, California University,
1887.</p>

Von Ochenkowski thinks the relation of municipalities and
crafts depended on the relative force of the three principles then
contending for the mastery&mdash;feudal rights, the king’s will, and
the common law; in the conflicts between guilds and towns he sees
the alternating forces of the king’s law and of the common law.
(Wirthschaftliche Entwickelung, 59-60.) Many homelier causes
than this were probably at work.</p>

In 1376 the judges held that no guild could be established
save by royal charter. (Seligman in his Med. Guilds p. 66, quotes
Year Book 49, Edward III. fol. 36.) On the other hand in
1376 the commons presented a petition complaining that many
of the mayors were prevented from exercising their office
thoroughly by the special charters which had been granted to
certain misteries and praying that these special charters might
be withdrawn so as to strengthen the hands of the local authorities.
(Rot. Parl. ii. 331 No. 54.) See Gross i. 113 note 2. For
instances of royal charters to guilds see the Mercers of Shrewsbury
(Hibbert, 64), the Tailors of London (Clode’s Merchant
Tailors), and various companies in Hull (Lambert’s Two

Ibid. i. 124 note 2. Von Ochenkowski (Wirthschaftliche
Entwickelung, 67) argues that this regulation was made in consequence
of the mediæval view of trade as a public trust not a
mere individual act; and that skill in craft was taken as a test
of uprightness of character and a pledge of fitness for citizenship.
From this conclusion follows the belief, which in its turn supports
the conclusion, that the rule was one imposed by the town
authorities and not by the will of the crafts.</p>

This history has been treated by Dr. Gross in his “Gild

in at least one-third and probably in a much greater proportion
of the English boroughs. (Gross, i. 2, 22, 158.)</p>

Gross, i. 61-63, 85. Sometimes the grant of a guild was given
before the grant of other rights. In other cases it followed. Thus
in Gloucester the first charter was given by Henry the Second “to
my burgesses of Gloucester” in 1155. The Guild did not appear in
the charter till 1200, when John granted certain municipal rights
to “our burgesses of Gloucester,” and others mainly of a trading
sort to “our burgesses of Gloucester of the Merchant Guild”;
and in 1227 a charter of Henry the Third seems for the first
time to enact that burgesses must not only dwell in the borough,
hold land, and pay lot and scot, but must also “be in the
Merchant Guild and Hanse.”</p>

Dr. Gross holds that all guilds of merchants formed after the
decline of the Gilda Mercatoria in the thirteenth century must
be considered as being merely craft-unions of the ordinary kind&mdash;in
most cases superseding the Guild Merchant (i. 129).</p>

Ibid. 118, 163. The appellation of the Guild Merchant “was
more frequently applied to the aggregate of the crafts” than to
the governing body of the borough. (Ibid. i. 114.) In Carlisle
had the term “been used at all, <i>it would probably have been
applied</i> to the eight guilds aggregately, rather than to the Corporation.”
(Ibid. ii. 40.) In proving that the later Guild Merchant
was “an aggregate of the crafts,” Dr. Gross carries us at a
single step into a much later period (pp. 118-123), where the
name tells us little apart from the history of the borough. The
case of Coventry seems a doubtful instance.</p>

Dr. Gross argues that any struggle which did take place
was not between the Guild Merchant and the crafts, but between
“the governing council (the “magnates,” “potentiores,” etc.) on
the one side and the burgesses at large (“communitas,” “populus,”
“minores”) on the other.” (Gross i. 110, 285.) The “magnates” of
Norwich (Hudson’s Mun. Org. p. 24-5), or “les riches” of the
city records, ruled in a city where there was no Guild Merchant.
The “potentiores” of Lynn seem from the printed records to
have been the Guild Merchant. In the town records “communitas”
cannot be understood as synonymous with “populus,”
still less with “minores.”</p>

Gross, i. 109. “Not a single unmistakable example of such a
conflict has ever been deduced.” On this point Seligman
(Mediæval Guilds, 57-8) speaks very dogmatically on most inconclusive
evidence, so far as this is given in his notes. The analogy
on p. 58 of craft guilds including smaller unions is not shewn,
nor their common occurrence proved.</p>

In London, Norwich, and the Cinque Ports, there was no Guild
Merchant at any time. In Lynn, Andover, Southampton, and
Bristol it was all-powerful. In Nottingham no influence of its
action can be traced; the guild mentioned in John’s charter
(Nott. Rec. i. 9) is only once mentioned afterwards, in 1365.

Compare Chesterfield, where a Guild was established in 1218
to guard the “liberties of the town”; in case of need its aldermen
were to choose twelve men to go before the justices or
elsewhere to help these “liberties” of the town; and any one
suffering loss for them was to be repaid by the Guild. (English

The early guildhall of York belonged to the guilds of S.
George and S. Christopher; and when the new hall was built in
the middle of the fifteenth century these two guilds retained
considerable power in it. (Davies’ Walks Through York, 49-51.)
Sir William Plumpton and his wife joined the fraternity of S.
Christopher at York, 1439. (Plumpton Corr. lxii.)</p>

Accounts of the Guild of Corpus Christi are preserved from
1488. The brethren and sisters of the Guild seem to have been
spread all over England, and are mentioned at London, Lynn,
and Birmingham. They were of all ranks and of all trades and
callings. (Hist. MSS. Com. i. 101.) The Prior of the cathedral,
the Prior’s bailiff, the vicar of Trinity, various craftsmen of the
town and vicars of the neighbourhood, merchants of Queenborough,
Dublin, Drogheda, Bristol, Kingston-on-Hull, London,
and many other places, a “merchant of the Staple,” and great
men of the neighbourhood, such as Thomas Grey, the Marquis of
Dorset, Lord Hastings, and others belonged to its association.</p>

The list compiled in 1449 of living craftsmen who had held
office gives fifteen drapers and eleven mercers, and seven dyers;
as against two wire-drawers, two whit-tawyers, and two weavers.
The dyers in Coventry were often cloth merchants of great consequence.</p>

In the time of Richard the Second the fullers and tailors
first attempted to form a guild, and even obtained a patent
which licensed their society to hold property worth a yearly
rental of eight marks.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_407_407" id="Footnote_407_407"></a><a href="#FNanchor_407_407"><span class="label">[407]</span></a></span>
The complaint against the dyers is shown in a petition to
Parliament in 1415 (Rot. Parl. iv. 75), in which the community
of Coventry say that by reason of a confederacy among the dyers
they cannot get their cloth dyed under 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i> a dozen, whereas
last year’s price was 5<i>s.</i>; and forty pounds of wool was now 30<i>s.</i>
which was last year 20<i>s.</i>, &amp;c. The dyers are also great and common
makers of cloth and take all the flower of the wool for their
own cloth, the remnant serving the common people. The
petitioners request that on the day of the mayor’s election, those
that elect him (that is twenty-four members of the ruling guilds)
shall also appoint four persons, two drapers, one dyer, and one
woder, sworn to keep watch over the dyers, and present them for
any “fault or confederacy” to the mayor, bailiffs, and justices
of the peace&mdash;in other words to the officers of the Trinity Guild.
For the first fault he was to pay a fine to the king, for the second
a fine and half a year’s imprisonment. They also prayed that no
one who was a dyer should make vendible cloth. These conditions
being refused they claimed the suppression of the guild.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_408_408" id="Footnote_408_408"></a><a href="#FNanchor_408_408"><span class="label">[408]</span></a></span>
The mayor and his brethren carried their complaint to the
king in 1424, and by royal writ the assemblies were forbidden.
In 1422 the governing guilds issued an order that all wardens
should bring the ordinances of the crafts before the mayor,
recorder, and bailiffs, and eight of the general council by whom
honest, lawful, and good rules should be allowed; and no
ordinances might be made against the law in oppression of
people, upon pain of imprisonment or fine at the king’s will. In
1424 arbitrators were appointed by the mayor’s order to decide
the disputes between the master weavers and their men; and
rules were drawn up for the whole craft. It is obvious that this
is very different from regulation by a guild which still retained
the crafts within its own association.</p>

They gave forty marks for a fresh license for their guild
with mortmain up to ten marks, and leave to elect four masters
at the Nativity to rule the craft and to plead in courts for
the whole body. As of old they seem to have failed in carrying
out their scheme in spite of the license, and in 1448 a petition
was presented by them (whether it was voluntary may well be
doubted) that the union between the fullers’ and tailors’ crafts
should be severed. At the suppression of the guilds the shearmen
and tailors held a mill and tenements in mortmain for the
support of their chauntry.</p>

How little freedom was left to far the most powerful craft
of all&mdash;the dyers&mdash;we see from the law of 1530, that if any
masters and journeymen of the dyers can be proved before the
mayor and justices to have hindered any one from becoming a
dyer, they are to be fined. If the journeymen refuse to work for
the new dyers, then, without hindrance from the craft or the
journeymen, they may hire others not inhabitants. In 1530 it
was ordered that a certain Robert Perkins was to become a dyer
without “let or hindrance” from craft and journeymen. In
general the corporation resisted the tendency of the lesser crafts
to prevent the setting up of new masters&mdash;a policy which is easy
to understand in the rule of merchants, as opposed to that of the
manufacturers.</p>

It is possible that in the earlier part of Richard’s reign the fear
inspired by the Peasant Revolt may have quickened the spirit of
organization among the wealthier classes. In the Guild of
Lichfield, established by charter in 1387, the master of the Guild
and the Forty-eight were “steadfastly to abide together and see
that good rule be kept in the city.” (Gross, ii. 145.) Similar
combinations of the richer classes seem to have been very
general.</p>

Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 316. This states that all the burgesses
and the commonalty of the borough of Bridgewater have ordained
that they will choose yearly two seneschals of their guild, and one
bailiff to attend on them; such seneschals to have power to punish
those offending against these ordinances. If any one among them
shall maliciously impute to another a charge of theft, forgery,
neifty (“nativitatis,” the being a born bondman), murder,
adultery, or excommunication, and be convicted thereof before
the seneschals, he shall be amerced and bound to the commonalty
to make satisfaction to the other at the award of his peers.
No one shall implead another without the borough under pain of
amercement. Any one neglecting to appear before the seneschals
when summoned is to be amerced. Those opposing execution or
distress made by order of the seneschals to be amerced and bound
to the commonalty in forty pence. No one is to buy flesh or fish
before 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> for regrating under pain of becoming bound to the
commonalty in the price of the flesh or fish so bought or sold.
If any one is elected to the office of seneschal of S. Mary’s or of
the Holy Cross in the church of the said borough he shall render
account for the moneys arising therefrom to the said seneschals
whenever summoned so to do. Any person refusing any one of
those offices, if elected thereto, is to be bound to the commonalty
in the sum of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> The seneschals are to render account for
all moneys received by them each year upon the morrow of the
circumcision of our Lord. This deed has a large fragment of
the castle seal or seal of the lord of the fee still attached. (Hist.

Journ. Arch. Ass. xxvii. 462. If a townsman struck the
mayor and was too harshly punished the friends of the prisoner
might call a jury “of the discreetest and stoutest men of the
city,” who should ordain a just penalty. In Rye as in Hereford
the old custom was that the man who struck the mayor was to
lose his right hand (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 352); in Preston there was
some punishment for a mayor who struck a burgess in or out of
court (Custumal, Hist. Preston Guild). In Canterbury if a
bailiff did wrong to any “that may be found by two lawful
men of syght and of hyerth” complaint was made to the twelve
aldermen; and if they charged the bailiff in vain to amend the
wrong, the case was carried to a court of the thirty-six, the
aldermen, and the most wisest men, “and by them right shall
be ordained” (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 171).</p>

Mr. Maitland describes the communal organization of the
villein tenants on the manor of Bright Waltham in 1293 (Manorial
Pleas, Selden Soc. 161-4, 168). They formed a “communitas”
which held property, could receive a grant of land, could contract
and make exchanges with the lord (172). These rights were
recognized in the manorial courts, though at Westminster they
would have been held very irregular (163). They elected or
recommended the reeve, shepherd, ploughman, swineherd (170),
the whole ville “undertaking” for him (168). The steward kept
watch that no land of servile tenure should be treated as free,
and the villeins themselves were very unwilling that a villein
should set up as a freeman on the ground of holding a freehold
acre (164).</p>

Frequent cases indicate that where the common lands played
an important part in the wealth or industry of a borough the
burgesses long preserved an interest in municipal affairs. Thus,
in Haverford West, where the townsfolk up to 1832 took a very
real part in the election of their officers and the control of
business, the common meadow still contained over a thousand
acres. (Report on Mun. Corporation, 233, etc.) And at Berwick-on-Tweed,
where also affairs were administered by the whole
body of burgesses, the annual value of the lands whose profits
went to the freemen was near £6,000. (Ibid. 31.)</p>

In the list of taxpayers to the poll-tax of 1380 in Oxford, we
find four aldermen mentioned&mdash;a vintner, a draper, and two others
whose trade is not mentioned, but who had eight and ten servants,
a number very greatly above the average. The vintner and
draper each paid, like the mayor, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; but the man with
ten servants gave only 12<i>d.</i>; and the man with eight is not
registered as having paid at all. (Oxford City Documents, Oxford

Royal Commission on Markets, 15, 16. The justices had a
right to dismiss poor recognitors, and order the sheriff to cause
lawful knights and other proved discreet men to be elected in
their stead (Select Civil Pleas, Selden Society, 100). The records
of the Manchester Court Leet Jury have only been preserved
from 1552. The number varied from about fourteen to eighteen,
who were yearly chosen at the court leets from the chief
burgesses of the town. When the father died his eldest son
or younger brother seems to have been made a juror in his
stead. The jurors, in fact, were chosen generation after generation
from the same small number of families. The reeve and
one or both constables were generally nominated from among
the jury then in the box. (Manchester Court Leet Records,
177-8.) Cf. Ship of Fools. Barclay, 99.</p>

The possible difficulty of getting rid of a clerk is illustrated
by what happened when the mayor, sheriffs, alderman, and commons
of York, in 1475, by their whole and common assent, dismissed
the common clerk “for divers and many offences&mdash;excessive
takings of money, misguiding of their books, accounts,
and evidences, with other great trespasses.” They then wrote to
D. of Gloucester to entreat his good lordship and that he would
move the king to allow them to name another common clerk;
and the Duke having sent letters to Lord Hastings and Lord
Stanley, finally received an answer from the king that he had
commissioned two serjeants of the law to examine the case, that
they had reported in favour of the corporation, and that a new
clerk might be elected. The grateful town agreed at a meeting
of the council that the D. of Gloucester “for his great labour
now late made unto the king’s great grace” should “be presented
at his coming to the city with 6 swans and 6 pikes.”

In Sandwich the “town clerk’s” salary was 40<i>s.</i> a year, out
of which he had to find parchment, except when he wrote out the
cesses, when the commonalty might give him a shilling or two
for the parchment and his trouble. Other small payments fell to
him when a freeman was made or a corporation letter was signed
or suchlike business done. (Boys’ Sandwich, 476.) In 1390
Romney paid as much as 56<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; then the salary fell to 40<i>s.</i> in
1428; then to 32<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>; and then to 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, with 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for
parchment. (Ibid. 803.) This corresponded with the decline in
the fortunes of Romney.</p>

The common clerk at Hythe, John Smallwood, secured for
himself a following of thirty-six men sworn to help him in all his
undertakings, and in 1397 he had even gathered sixty men
pledged to bring about the death of four of his enemies. For
four years the town refused to have any clerk at all, until at last
Smallwood made his peace in 1414 by the gift of certain tenements
and lands. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv. part 1, 437-8.)</p>

Occasionally we find odd instances of growing independence.
In Worcester “at some seasons of wilfulness” the people had
shewn their revolutionary temper by choosing for serjeants and
constables “persons of worship, to the dishonour of them and of
the said city;” and an ordinance was made in 1467 that none of
the twenty-four or the forty-eight might be appointed to these
offices. (English Guilds, 409.) In like manner the great court
of Bridgenorth decreed in 1503 that no burgess should be
made serjeant. (Hist. MSS. Com. x. 4, 426.) In 1350 a guild
was formed in Lincoln of “common and middling folks” who
strongly objected to any one joining them “of the rank of mayor
or bailiffs,” or claiming dignity for his personal rank, and made
a rule that if any such persons insisted on entering their society
they should not meddle with its business and should never be
appointed officers. (English Guilds, 178-9.)</p>

The differences of early charters should all be studied. See, for

The complexity and apparently inexhaustible confusion of
their methods is well illustrated by the lists drawn up in 1833
by the commissioners appointed to inquire into municipal corporations.
See appendix to the Rep. on Mun. Corpor. 94,
95; and especially the tables on pp. 102-132. Evidently
the burghers have scarcely deserved the reproach of those who
consider direct election by the people as the natural rude expedient
of unlearned men grouped in political societies and ignorant of
the wiser system of nomination which commends itself to trained
legislators.</p>

and complicated as those of mayor and council. For illustrations

There was also a “Great Court” of twenty-four. Hist.
MSS. Com. x. part 4, pp. 425-7. At Melcombe Regis (Hist.
MSS. Com. v. 578) there was an electing jury of twelve. In
Preston the mayor chose in open court two ancient discreet
and honest burgesses, who took an oath that they would at
once select twenty-four burgesses who should not bear any
office in the town during the next year. The twenty-four having
been chosen and sworn, elected a mayor, a bailiff, and a sub-bailiff;
these three at once took their respective oaths, and the
mayor before he left the hall appointed a mayor’s bailiff and a
serjeant. Laws were made by the “mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses,
with all the commonalty, by a whole assent and consent.”
Government seems to have been carried on by the mayor
and “twelve of those who with him are ordained,” and who were
known as aldermen or capital burgesses. By a guild law earlier
than 1328 former mayors and bailiffs, though they might sit
on the bench as aldermen, were not allowed to meddle with
the twenty-four during the election, under penalty of a fine of
twenty shillings or loss of citizenship. (Preston, Guild Record,
xxiv. Guild ordinances in history of Preston Guild, by Dobson
and Harland, 12, 17, 19-23.)</p>

See note A, p. 283, Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 171-2. This plan was
perhaps modelled on a system common in ecclesiastical elections
and possibly peculiar in Canterbury so far as municipalities were
concerned. There was a dispute in 1435 about the mode of
presentation to S. Peter’s, Cornhill, to avoid the “great strife and
controversy” between the mayor, aldermen, and common council.
It was decided that the mayor and aldermen should choose four
priests living within the city or a mile of it; that these four
should name to the common council four clerks “most meet in
manners and conyng”; and that out of these four the mayor,
aldermen, and council should choose one. Three Fifteenth century

In Bridport there were twelve jurors. (Hist. MSS. Com. vi.
489-90, 492-3.) In Southampton twelve “discreets,” p. 308.
The jurats in Romney and others of the Cinque Ports formed a
similar body. So also in Carlisle, and in Pontefract. (Hist. MSS.
Com. viii. 270-1.) A writ from the privy council was addressed
to “the mayor, bailiffs, and twenty-four notablest burgesses of
our town of Northampton” in 1442. (Proceed. Privy Council
v. 191.) Wells had a council of twenty-four. (Hist. MSS. Com.
i. 106-7.)</p>

Oxford, by a charter of Richard the First, had a mayor and
two aldermen. In 1255 Henry the Third made the aldermen
four, corresponding to the four wards of the city, and joined
with them eight leading burgesses mainly to keep peace in the
city and to have charge of the assize of bread, beer, and wine.
The twenty-four common councilmen were elected from the
citizens at large. (Boase’s Oxford, 42-44.) In Ipswich besides
the twelve “honest and loyal” portmen elected yearly in the
cemetery of S. Mary Tower there was a council of twenty-four;
and seven of the portmen and thirteen of the twenty-four could
together make rules for the town. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 242, 244.)
In Yarmouth (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 305; Blomefield, xi. 301-2,
342), twenty-four jurats (afterwards called aldermen) were chosen
by the burgesses, and appointed all the officers of the town.
Between 1400 and 1407 changes were made in the constitution.
Two bailiffs were elected instead of four, and besides the council
of twenty-four aldermen a common council was formed of forty-eight
members. So also in Colchester and Norwich. Worcester
had two councils, “the twenty-four above and the forty-eight
beneath.” (English Guilds, 379, 396. Also Leicester, Hist. MSS.
Com. viii. 425.) Canterbury had an upper council of twelve and
another of thirty-six. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 171-2.) For councils
of seventy and eighty see pp. 374, 432. In Chester a charter of
1506 gave twenty-four aldermen and forty of the common council.
(Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 359-60.) In Bristol (Hunt’s Bristol,
85-86) and Liverpool (Picton ii. 26) the council was composed
of forty “honest and discreet” men. Colchester had two councils
of sixteen each. (Cromwell’s Colchester, 265.)</p>

The manner in which the aldermen took their place in the
system of municipal government has not yet been worked out.
In London, Canterbury, and Lincoln they were hereditary owners
of the various wards. The people of Coventry petitioned for
aldermen over the wards in 1450, but the mayor and his brethren
refused. In Lynn there were only constables of the wards.</p>

townsmen were charged to their account, and they had to submit
patiently to their exactions; a letter from Edward the Fourth
ordered the town to release one of the Bowers who had been

on paying him his wages like other Bowers. (Hist. MSS. Com.

Davies speaks of this John Ingoldsby who paid the debt as
afterwards apparently one of the Barons of the Exchequer (p. 38.)
A John Ingoldsby had been Recorder of Southampton from at

In this last case they were comforted by a promise of release

The Southampton trade did in fact utterly fail before a
century was over. In 1530 its rent was reduced by £26 13<i>s.</i> <i>d.</i>,
and in 1552 the King ordered that when the customs at the port
did not amount to £200, and no ships called carracks of Genoa
and galleys of Venice should enter the port to load or unload,
the town should not pay the accustomed rent of £200, but only
£50. To this day certificates are still prepared every year on
November 9th that no carracks of Genoa nor galleys of Venice
have arrived at the port. (Davies, 38-9. Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3,
49.)</p>

Unfortunately in the brief extracts from the Southampton
records which have been as yet published, references to municipal
government are so scanty that any sketch of it can only be
drawn in faint and uncertain outline. In the opinion of Dr.
Gross the Merchant Guild was originally a strictly private
fraternity, and only became the dominant burghal authority in
the fourteenth century. (Gross, ii. 231.) I have suggested here
the idea of an earlier connexion; but the question needs full
examination.</p>

Davies, 155. It is possible that at this time the chief
aldermen were fashioned into a close body elected for life after

and their wives in the orthodox scarlet robes with fur and velvet,
in all points the same as those of the mayor. 235.</p>

Gross, ii. 225. Davies (p. 136) says that whenever the guild
became settled as the supreme authority, there entered at that
period an element of restriction alien from the more ancient
government of the towns; and traces to the guild the narrowing
of common privileges and subjection of the community to an
exclusive system of local administration. It is possible that
wherever a guild merchant did lay hold on a town government,
as here, at Lynn, or at Coventry, the tendency may always have
been to intensify the existing tendencies to the despotic rule of
the richer citizens.</p>

Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 91, 107; Davies, 164. In Nottingham,
as in Southampton, we have an occasional indication that the burgesses
or common councillors, possibly under some fit of impatience
at the pretensions of the aldermen, had intermittent tendencies to
side with the people. In Southampton there was possibly at this
time a certain bond of sympathy, for seven years earlier, in
1452, the burgesses complained that the aldermen had assumed
the right of retaining, as justices of the peace, fines which had
always gone to them towards the payment of the ferm; and their
contention having been maintained in Parliament, royal orders
were sent to the aldermen to molest the burgesses no more.

The same sense of insufficiency of the common to the increasing

was made on Sept. 16th, 1892, by the Mayor and corporation for
a graving dock&mdash;part of the harbour improvements by which
Southampton is to be restored to its old supremacy on the
southern coast and once more to give room in its port to the
largest steamers afloat. There was a far-away echo of old
world controversies in the assurance of the mayor to the people
that by this act of the corporation in giving the land at a
nominal consideration there was scarcely anybody in Southampton
who would not be benefited, and “not a soul in Southampton
would be injured.”</p>

In 1378 a commission was appointed to inquire into the
obstructions of the Trent. Nottingham Records, i. 198. Again
in 1382 the King was moved by the “clamorous relation” of the
men of Nottingham and a royal proclamation was issued to forbid
the raising of such tolls; while a new commission was appointed
in the following year, 1383, to prevent Richard Byron, lord of
Colwick, from directing the waters of the Trent to his own uses
to the injury of Nottingham. (Ibid. i. 225, 227, 413.) Sir John
Babington, who owned considerable land in Nottingham, seems to
have quarrelled with the corporation about 1500. They appealed
to Sir Thomas Lovel for help, who answered that he had written
to him to demean himself as he ought to do until Lovel had
examined the case and decided on it. (Ibid. iii. 402.)</p>

The land was let for thirty years at the yearly rent of a rose,
and the corporation was to make enclosures of ditches and

that in this case the word community was sometimes used; the
term varied no doubt according to the exact body in which the
right was vested that formed the subject of the treaty, and this
again might depend partly on the date at which the right was
acquired. Cf. the various styles used in Calender of Letters of

In 1435 we read of the mayor, and nine, or possibly eleven,
burgesses named “and many other commons in the said hall,”
(Nott. Rec. ii. 362.) In 1443 there is something very like the council&mdash;the
mayor, four justices of the peace named, John Orgram and
other “trustworthy men” of the town, and the two chamberlains,
who acted “with the assent of the whole community of the
town.” (Ibid. ii. 408.) For the fine see ii. 424.</p>

The editor of the Records, Mr. Stevenson, accepts this statement
of Gregory, and says that “The council had no existence
prior to 1446, and it was at first merely a committee appointed by
the burgesses for the management of the affairs of the town.”
According to him the townspeople were accustomed to assemble
for the discussion of any important business, and “this was the
system of government in use prior to the establishment of this
committee in 1446.” (Nott. Rec. iv. ix.) He believes further that
“it was, no doubt, the abuses arising from this system and the
inconvenience of having to call a meeting of the whole community
for the consideration of every question connected with the ruling
of the town that caused the burgesses to choose the committee of
1446.” (Ibid. xi.)</p>

Ibid. ii. 186 <i>et sq.</i> There are passages in the charter which
seem to convey this impression. In 1465 Elizabeth Woodville

known (ii. 255-7).</p>

Ibid. ii. 425; iv. xii. 2. The aldermen were still merged for
general business in the council, and appear only three times,
possibly acting as a kind of separate estate&mdash;once in 1450 when
some land was let by the mayor, sheriffs, chamberlains, aldermen,
and the whole community; once twenty years later, when in
1471 a complaint was addressed to the King by the mayor,
aldermen, and commonalty; and once in 1504 when an ordinance
was made by the mayor and aldermen to reduce certain fines to
be paid by them for neglect of financial duties, to which they
obtained the consent of councillors and commons. (Nott. Rec.
iii. 325; iii. 408; ii. 334.) In the first two cases the word may
have been used to denote the whole council.</p>

Nott. Rec. iv. xi. xii. xiv. xv. We have only records of the completed

See p. 350. In an agreement made in 1500 between the
mayor, council and clothing the names of six inhabitants are
included, apparently unofficial, and possibly representatives of the
commons. (Nott. Rec. iii. 301.) The names set down for the
election of the mayor and officers for the next year are the mayor,
recorder, six aldermen, six common councillors, two sheriffs,
the six (apparently) plain burgesses mentioned in the last list,
and twenty-four others of the clothing. (Compare the lists

The importance to the burgesses of the common lands may
be illustrated by their argument in 1577 against admitting new
burgesses “for there is too many of them already; by making of
them the poor burgesses commons is eaten up, to the great
hindrance of all.” At the same time they insisted that if a
burgess let out his part of the land it should be to a burgess and
not to a foreigner. (Nott. Rec. iv. 171, 172.)</p>

Ibid. iv. 282. “We present the new council for not setting
the town’s grounds to the true meaning of their new election, but
hath taken the best ground to the richest men, and let the poor
men have nothing that are ancienter burgesses. Also we find
that the whole house or the most of them overhipt (passed over)
themselves as it came to them by order of their names in the book
while they were disposing of Hartliff ground and the coppices, but
now that the East Steaner and other good closes come to be disposed
of, they share them themselves, and leaves poor men
unserved that are both ancient and needful.” This happened in
1606 when the council had got control of the land.</p>

Ibid. ii. 420. No doubt one of the grievances of the people
under a despotic administration was the being deprived of any
adequate control over the admission of new burgesses to share
their lands. Compare Ibid. iii. 459 etc. with the constant

interesting to compare the procedure at Coventry, as taken by
Miss Dormer Harris from the records. All petitions to be laid
before the court were given in to the mayor four days before the
meeting of the Leet; and these were inspected by twenty-four
men summoned by the mayor. On the day of the Leet these

In September, 1514, John Rose, mayor, and the burgesses of
the town gave a licence to John Sye to enclose part of the common
ground for his use at a rent of 2<i>s.</i> a year. (Nott. Rec.
iii. 125.) But in February, 1515, when leave was given to the
guardians of the free school to enclose land express mention is
made of the mayor, burgesses, and community. (iii. 457.) The
agreement in 1516 about the Lenton fair was made between the
convent and the mayor, sheriffs, burgesses, and commonalty.

Nottingham Records, iv. xiii. For a case in which this
certainly happened see p. 356. The same thing seems to have
happened in 1504. A law of 1442 had ordered that if the mayor
and bailiffs did not render up their accounts before leaving office
they should be fined, £20 for the mayor, £10 for the bailiffs; in
1504 the mayor and aldermen together issued a new ordinance
reducing the fine to one half, an ordinance which was assented
to by three common councillors, while for the commonalty appear
the names of seventeen burgesses, of whom one was certainly one
of the sheriffs. (Ibid. ii. 424; iii. 325.)</p>

According to Mr. Hudson the Norwich Leet Juries were
solely a “police” organization. They existed to make “presentments”
which involved a certain amount of previous keeping of
the peace in their own little neighbourhood. In their <i>individual</i>
capacity the capital pledges were the precursors of the “petty
constable” [see Selden Soc. v. lxii. no. 1, and cf. pages there
cited]; in their <i>collective</i> capacity as juries they preceded the local
“Justice of the Peace,” a function usurped to a small extent
between (say) 1360 and 1420 by the “twenty-four citizens,” and
afterwards wholly usurped by the “Court of Aldermen,” who
were the borough magistrates.</p>

Norwich Town Close Evidences, 14, 24, 27, 31, 32. The
same form was used even after the charter of 1403, in 1420 and
1435. (Ibid. 46.) We find “the citizens” joined with “the
commonalty” in the thirteenth century. An enrolled deed of
1290, in which license to build a stall in the market is granted
by the “Communitas Norwici et cives ejusdam civitatis,” is
quoted by Mr. Hudson. (See Mun. Org., Arch. Journ. xlvi. no.
184.) The double style used is, I think, explained by a contention
which occurred a century later, in 1379. “There was a
discussion whether the stalls in the meat-market ought to belong
to the commonalty or to the bailiffs. They are agreed that the
said stalls shall in future remain to the commonalty for ever,
without challenge or contradiction to the present bailiffs or the
bailiffs in future.” (Town Close Evidences, 31.) At that time
a great reorganization of the market was in progress (see Kirkpatrick’s
“Streets and Lanes of Norwich,” App. i. pp. 95, 96)
with a view to getting as many stalls as possible into the hands
of the authorities. As the bailiffs had certain sources of income
allotted to them (they being personally responsible for the fee
ferm rent) they need not be blamed for trying to help themselves.
On the other hand the attempt shows how significant was the
use of the word “communitas” in the older deed (see p. 364 no. 1).
I think it very possible that property set apart for a definite
public purpose was held in the joint names of citizens and commonalty;
but I am convinced this last word was never used in a
formal way, but always expressed a tenure and control with
which the “cives” or the twenty-four could not interfere.</p>

Ibid. 29. Evidently this was a time of very active municipal
life. About 1372 the corporation seems to have begun
copying out carefully older legal documents, and this copying
and re-writing went on through the next century. The account-books
which still exist began to be kept in 1393. In 1378 the
income of the city was £374 17 <i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Blomefield, iii. 103.</p>

Mr. Hudson informs me that there are rolls (more or less
perfect) for about half the years between 1365 and 1385. Then
they fail till 1413, when the constitution of the assembly had
been entirely altered.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_743_743" id="Footnote_743_743"></a><a href="#FNanchor_743_743"><span class="label">[743]</span></a></span>
I have to thank Mr. Hudson for his kindness in giving me
this information. He tells me that an assembly on October 7th,
1372, is thus described: “Prima congregatio ibidem tenta die
Jovis, &amp;c. ... quatuor Ballivis (eleven persons specially named)
et aliis de com’tate presentibus.” This is the constant form in
use, whenever the attendance is recorded, down to the last of
these rolls in 1385. The number of persons specially named
varies from eleven to seventeen. Their similarity in the course
of each year suggests that they were specially bound to attend.
In two years 1377-8 and 1379-80 the attendances are recorded
several times, and, as in the first case the total number of persons
named is twenty-five and in the other twenty-four, it seems
reasonably certain that they were the actual twenty-four. This
is confirmed by the fact that almost all the “committee,” as
they would now be called, are appointed from their number and
almost the whole burden of administration is undertaken by one
or other of them in conjunction with the bailiffs.</p>

Town Close Evidences, 36. In considering the new style
two views present themselves. We may lay the whole stress on
the association of mayor and sheriffs instead of bailiffs with “the
citizens and commonalty”; or, as I incline to think, we may
also attach importance to the formal association in a charter of
“citizens” and “commonalty,” as marking an epoch in the civic
history.</p>

In 1354 it was ordered that London aldermen should not
be elected yearly but hold office for life. (Stow’s London, 189.)
A common council appears as early as 1273; and again in 1347.
It was then chosen by the mayor, aldermen, and representatives
from the wards. At the end of Edward’s reign the election was
transferred to the trading companies, but restored to the wards
in 1384; to be given back to the companies by Edward the
Fourth in 1467; and restored to the wards in 1650. (Merewether

In 1423 when the mayor and other judges sat in the city
there appeared before them two coroners, 16 constables for the
four wards, the constables for the liberties of Holmestrete and
Spitelond, with the bailiff of the prior’s liberties in those places,
and four men out of each ward possibly for jurymen. In 1424 a
tripartite indenture was made by the mayor, aldermen, and
commons, with constitutions for the better government of the
city, and was ratified at a common assembly in the guild hall.

In the list given in English Guilds there is one guild
founded in 1307 and ten (or eleven, if we count the masons’
guild on p. 39) founded between 1350 and 1385, some of them craft
guilds, others nominally social or religious associations, though it
is very probable that in many cases this was but a thin disguise
for a craft guild. English Guilds, 14, etc.</p>

The composition of 1415 decided that each craft in the city
was yearly to choose two masters, whose names were to be presented
for the mayor’s consent, and who were to take their oaths
before him. The Monday after the mayor’s “riding” these
masters were to make good and true search in their crafts and to
present all offenders before the mayor for judgement; and half
the fines were given to the sheriffs, half to the masters of the
crafts. The mayor had to accept the presentment of the
“masters”; he could not make search either himself or by any
of the town officers; only if a craft refused to be searched or to
elect masters the mayor might himself appoint two masters and
order the search. If the masters concealed any notable default
they were to be punished by the advice of the mayor and more
sufficient men of the same craft. (Town Close Evidences, 41, 42.)</p>

On being enrolled each man must pay to the craft 40 pence,
and to the chamber at least 20<i>s.</i> and “more after the quantity
of his good.” (Town Close Evidences, 42.) The profits of
admission to the freedom of the city had in old times gone half
to the bailiffs and half to the community, but now the craft
claimed a definite share of the entrance money. (Arch. Journ.
xlvi. no. 184, p. 328.) By the composition six men were to be
chosen “to be of counsel with the chamberlains in receiving of
burgesses.”</p>

1/2<i>d.</i> was paid for each piece sealed. The right was leased
to two citizens at 20 marks rent. Blomefield, iii. 125. By the
law of 1442 the weavers were to choose every year four wardens
from the craftsmen of the town, who should in their turn choose
two inspectors or overseers for the stuff out of Norfolk. The
wardens tested the faulty goods and received half of any forfeited
stuffs. The law of 1445 ordered them to choose four wardens
for Norwich and four for Norfolk, and directed the wardens
to make such laws as were needful for the improvement of the
trade. (20 Henry VI. cap. 10; 23 Henry VI. cap. 3; 7 Edward

in the chapel of the Virgin Mary in the Fields. (Ibid. 92.)
Most of the city business was done there as late as 1455.

themselves of other people’s accommodation (the Priory, Black

Charges that the mayor had sealed with the common seal
measures bigger than the standard measures for certain favoured
citizens, and that the people were forced to sell to them by these
measures; that he had made an evil use of the Pye-powder
Court, using its summary and autocratic procedure to imprison
many men wrongly and tyrannically (one John Wetherby had
been imprisoned); and that he sustained an illegal guild in the city
called Le Bachery. In 1477 a statute was made that the Pye-powder
Court could only deal with contracts or bargains made
during the fair. (Blomefield, iii. 169.)</p>

Dr. Gross, taking the Trinity guild of Lynn as “a continuation
of the old guild merchant,” speaks of its “line of
developement” into a “simple, social-religious fraternity” (i.
161); and notes that “though the ancient function of the guild
had disappeared, its social-religious successor was a quasi-official
part of the civic polity” (p. 162). He does not, however, enable
us to trace any such “developement,” or to distinguish “ancient
functions” from later ones. From our first glimpse of the
guild in the charters of John and Henry the Third to the
patent of Henry the Fifth it seems to be singularly free from
change, nor is any evidence produced during these centuries for
its “transformation into a simple social-religious guild.” In the
case of Southampton Dr. Gross sees a developement of an exactly
opposite kind (ii. 231).</p>

The four chamberlains or treasurers were then to be chosen
from the body of burgesses, two by the mayor and jurats, two
by the burgesses. But, unlike Norwich, where the council and
commons divided the remaining elections between them, in Lynn
the only appointment left to the community besides the two
chamberlains was the prolocutor. Coroners and constables were
nominated by the people, and elected by the jurats, and the other
officers, the common clerk, serjeant, janitors, bell-man and wait,
taken from the general community both of burgesses and non-burgesses,
were directly appointed by the mayor and jurats.</p>

In 1426 the alderman of the guild chose four fit persons who
took the accustomed oath and entered the chamber; they chose
four others, who, after being sworn, were brought into the
chamber, and the eight then added to their number four more.
The whole body of twelve, after sitting from the tenth to the
third hour, were finally divided as to the election of the serjeant
who had in some way offended the community, and at whose
name a “great murmur now arose amongst the people” waiting
outside. He was, however, chosen after asking pardon of the
mayor and community for his offence. (Ibid. 160.) In 1477
another election is described, which was carried on in exactly the
same way. (Ibid. 169.) And in 1470, when a constable had to be
elected there was the same procedure.</p>

The gradual change in the mode of electing burgesses for
parliament illustrates the action of the councils in absorbing
influence. In 1314 the jury to elect the burgesses had been
chosen by a committee of twenty-six townsmen. But at least
from 1425 the mayor assumed the right of choosing the first four
of the jury, who then named the remaining eight. In 1433, if
not earlier, the mayor was bound to select two of the twenty-four
and two of the twenty-seven, and the added eight members were
all taken from the same bodies; and in 1442 this custom was
made into a permanent law. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3. 240, 157-8,
163-4, 166-9.) About 1523 the burgesses were chosen by the
twenty-four and twenty-seven voting personally in assembly;
this assembly, called the “House,” carried on all dealings with
members, instructed them, paid them, and received their
reports. The first effort of the burgesses at large to take
any part in election was at the Long Parliament. (Ibid. pp.
148-9.)</p>

least influential class of the burgesses.” But community was
used in exactly this sense in 1305. (Ibid. 187.)</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
